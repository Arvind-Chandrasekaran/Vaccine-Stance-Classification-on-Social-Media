These people make up nearly all hospitalizations and COVID-related illnesses. Furthermore, I'd posit that the more likely you are to decline the vaccine, the likelier you are to engage in riskier behaviors such as avoid mask-wearing.\n\nThe end result is that our healthcare system is being overrun again and it was COMPLETELY avoidable. As a result, those who may need medical care may be denied because there simply aren't enough resources.\n\nImagine that we are all in a flood and the waters are rising. We are all stranded on our roofs and emergency services are thinned out. Some idiots decide \"the flood isn't real\" and voluntarily jump into the water and start to drown, pleading for help.

If they have, also great, it's also somebody I could have a beer with. Maybe there's just one topic we shouldn't talk about, no big deal.\n\nBut not them. I just joined a subreddit dedicated to a TV show. There was a person on the show who had been prescribed gabapentin for depression. Gabapentin is not an anti depressant and ironically causes suicidal thoughts - this is written in bold on the drug. So I said some doctors were dumb. Coming from me, having been disabled by a doctor's malpractice at 31, this is a very reasonable thing to say.\n\nAnd then within an hour somebody had clicked on my name, went through my post history, and replied not about the TV show but with \"anti vaxxer\" accusations. These people have taken the fun out of life. We had a TV show we liked in common, but he just had to pry. When I clicked on his profile his avatar is a dude with a pink goatee, so I'm not entirely surprised.\n\nMy family is fighting daily amongst each other with the family medical professional pushing everyone else on how \"safe and effective\" it is and somebody else mulling over the decision every second of every day. This person keeps reminding me all the reasons they don't want to take it until I've finally said several times \"then don't take it, but shut the hell up about it already\"\n\nWhat is this all about?

I'm due for a 2nd dose in 3 days, but the problem is I am currently in the US for the next 25 days and they only have Pfizer / Moderna vaccines here, no Sinovac CoronaVac anywhere. So I am going to miss / be late for my 2nd Sinovac dose.\n\nDue to some personal circumstances, I am considering to get fully-vaxxed with Pfizer / Moderna within the 25-day period I am here in the US, instead of taking the late 2nd dose of Sinovac upon return to the Philippines.\n\nHowever, I was told at a CVS near me that Sinovac and Pfizer / Moderna must not be taken together within 60 days of each other. As there isn't enough statistics on mixing vaccines, I figured that this 60-day thing is just a precautionary protocol without solid basis. I wonder what kind of risk I'm taking if I was to insist on taking 1st dose of Pfizer today then 2nd dose 21 days later, considering I've just been injected with Sinovac 25 days ago.\n\nI would appreciate some expert opinion and insight.\n\nTLDR: I have to be fully-vaxxed by November 20. I can make it if I take Pfizer today, except I took 1st of 2 doses of Sinovac 24 days ago and was told to wait 36 more days before taking Pfizer.",

I thought that it may be helpful to share what my side effects were. \n\nWithin about 30 minutes of receiving it, my arm was starting to feel a little bit weaker and tingly and I started developing a headache.\nWithin the next few hours the headache and arm soreness progressed, with the arm only getting to just a little sore and weak feeling. Not as bad as a tough workout. I was up and moving around at my job and I started getting pretty POTS-y. My heart rate was at &gt;=120 BPM and my balance and eyesight were both shaky. I made it back to my desk and drank a good amount of water including a nuun tablet over the course of the next hour and my body stabilized enough to feel okay. The rest of the day, I just made sure to be extra careful with my water intake and activity.\n\nOvernight, I slept poorly and my arm advanced to feeling like I had done a tough workout and also had a big bruise on the injection site. My headache has persisted, but is manageable with Tylenol.\n\n\n\nI hope that this information is helpful to anybody. Personally, I'd advise making sure that you have some good hydration options available for after the shot, and be prepared to take it easy day of.\n\nI've included my bio/health stats below just in case anybody is curious or wants to see how similar their symptoms may be.\n\n26F\n\nPOTS\n\nEDS-hypermobile type\n\nFibromyalgia\n\nPsoriasis\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\n\nCeliac disease\n\nScoliosis\n\nANA-positive\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n*2nd Dose Update *\n\nOkay, first 10-12 hours after getting the shot, I felt fine. My arm was only barely sore during this time. After that, it got rough.\nI tossed and turned all night with crazy fever dreams and was in a lot of pain all over. I also had a massive pounding headache. \n\nIn the morning I took my temperature and had a fever of 100.5 F. I usually run around 97.5 F, and very very rarely get fevers over 99.5, so this was distinct for me. I called into work for the day and have mostly been sleeping and occasionally taking Tylenol. My heart rate has been consistently over 120 bpm. \n\nIt's now been about 26 hours since receiving my 2nd dose and I'm feeling a bit better from this morning, but I still feel quite awful and feel unsteady when I stand up.\n\n\n\nMuch love and luck to you all.
