"To everyone here who supported me throughout my anxiety of getting the COVID vaccine
Thank you to everyone who reached out to me on my previous post here! Your kindness and reassurance was so helpful and extremely appreciated! 

I went and got the COVID vaccine yesterday, and you guys were right. The anticipation anxiety was much worst than the experience itself.
 I have a phobia of needles, and a bunch of other irrational fears and anxieties over all of this. 
So this took a lot out of me. 
I did have a mini panic attack afterwards when they told me to wait 10 mins, I got really hot and sweaty but I managed to tell myself ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœthis is NOT an allergic reaction, or anything like that. This is your anxiety trying to tell you to think it is. This is a symptom of anxiety itself and nothing moreÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and it went away immediately. 
Normally, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d panic harder thinking physical symptoms arenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t related to my anxiety. 
You have to remind yourself the physical things your body can do when youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re having anxiety, anxiety attacks, and panic attacks.
IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve had these feelings before with taking an unknown medication, or anything new like this. I just internally panic and idk why. 

I am trying to be stronger than who my anxiety is making me out to be. I often look back at the times I worried myself physically sick, and had massive anticipation anxiety over something, and probably 9.9 times out of 10 there was NOTHING to worry about. It was all fine. And in the case the thing that I was worried about did happen, it was less severe than it was to be worrying about it. 
IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m trying to remind myself of this! 
Anxiety is not helping me! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s usually not warning me of something dangerous! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s overworked because itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s part of my mental illness. But we can learn to overcome it and manage it, and hopefully be stronger than we ever were. 

Thank you again to everyone helping me through my anxiety of getting vaccinated. 
IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m so happy I finally did this, and I am sorry I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t do this sooner. 
ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s the next day for me and so far, I experienced just a sore arm and fatigue. I am aware that side effects could still happen, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m also reminding myself that it may not, and that if it does itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll all be okay. 
IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m telling my anxiety to not overreact and anticipate the worst, as it usually does. What is done is done.

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m also going to take a break from reading the scary parts of the internet. I know I should be smarter to know not to fall victim to that stuff, but they still scare me. And scaring me is not going to benefit me right now. 
I hate that the world is so against each other right now. It honestly breaks my heart to just simply be on the internet sometimes. 

Thank you so much to everyone here. You guys made me cry happy tears to just see such a supportive caring side of the internet. 
You guys helped me step into what I feel is the right direction. 
Thank you thank you thank you!!! 

TLDR: with the help of everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s support here, I finally faced my fears of needles, and other related anxieties of getting the vaccine. 
I revered my vaccine yesterday and so far everything went completely fine. Despite my anxiety telling me it wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t. 
Thank you so much to everyone here.",1
"A close family friend passed away because of COVID and I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t feel bad one bit.
This lady was my grandparents closest friend. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve known her my whole life and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been so kind to me every time IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve seen her. She always was so interested in what I was doing with my life and thought I was the best (even when I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t). 

That being said, she and her husband were extremely right wing and fully bought into the anti-vax, covid-isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t-real side and they were not quiet about their feelings at all. My view towards them has changed greatly the past year (past four years really) and I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t stand to be around them when I did see them. I had to keep quiet while they berated my views and looked down on my views about covid. 

Well my dad texted me today to tell me that she passed away from COVID and her husband is in the hospital, not doing well. I feel awful for my grandpa because he lost a good friend, but I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t feel bad at all that this lady passed away. She was given everything she could ever want in life due to her husbands wealth, but her ignorance and stupidity were the end of her. 

I shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t feel this way after losing a close family friend, but this has been the greatest ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœI told you soÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â of my life.",1

my country just announced that the majority of deaths right now comes from old people with the 2 jabs. I mean, what do you need more?!? it’s clear as day!!! it baffles me that ppl still want to take this shit into their bodies. 
they are beginning to vaccinate kids from 12 to 15! everyday the midia has a new case of young people dying after the vax but never make the correlation. this week a 19 year old just died a week after taking this shit and they are blaming it on alcohol! do you know how much alcohol you need to drink to actually die?

"Symptoms after first dose
So i took my first dose of pfizer on 10/1 and literally 15 minutes after my left leg went number after I felt numbness throughout my body. A few days after I got sharp pains randomly in my feet and hands. On 10/5 i went to ER for these symptoms and chest pains and tightness in chest. Doctors say its cause of inflammation and to take ibuprofen. It is now 10/7 and my numbness has subsided kind of but my chest still hurts and is tight. They said I am at 4% of getting a blood clot. Has anybody experienced this or similar side effects?",0
"Different covid vaccines for first and second dose?
Has anyone gotten two different shots for their first and second dose? I got Pfizer first and now will get moderna. Have there been any complications in doing this? I know a lot more people have gotten sick after moderna.",0
"Trolling got us 4 years of trump can it be used to fight Pro-Covid plague rats?
The answer is of course is yes, make a status update asking why folks are so against it, ask folks if they would take a vaccine for cancer, Alzheimer's, or autism or any such illness the closer to home the better, ask what they called those that didn't take the polio vaccine or any are there major illness that has been wiped out due to the greatness of vaccines? Don't tag folks but trust me the plague rats will come out just like your a Pied Piper!  And keep them strung along the longer you hold them in it might start to create doubt, shame, or maybe even a conscience in them, we gotta do whatever we can to stop Covid-19!",1
"COVID theories, tell me some.
I had COVID in November and it was like the flu on steroids. I really thought I was going to die, I came out of it pretty much 100% intact.  It was horrifying, It took a month though to regain my original strength. 
My boyfriend made me get the vaccine and I had a really bad reaction to it. CouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get up for three days, and that was the first dose. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve never had such a strong, awful reaction to a vaccine in my life. 

My mom doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to me get the second dose of the vaccine. 
Her theory is that itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s the elite preparing us for an even worse immune response to a disease in the future, that may be done to reduce the population?  She thinks bird and swine flu, weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re just test runs. My father told me that none of his rich friends are getting the vaccine and was angry at me for succumbing to the pressure. He lives in and knows a very affluent community in Virginia. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s your guess? I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t know what to believe and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m 
up to get my second dose soon.

My response to my mom was that doctors were the first to be immunized, would the elite try to kill the only people that will save their lives?",1

"My arm still hurts more than a month after COVID vaccine
I got the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine over a month ago and my arm still hurts, not enough to interfere with my daily life, but enough to limit my exercising. I don't know if I should go see my GP about it, it doesn't feel serious enough of an issue to make an appointment.
Could something have gone wrong with my jab? Is the soreness here to stay? Is there anything I can do to make the pain go away?

I got my shot in St. Thomas. All of the workers are extremely helpful and professional. In and out just took me about 30 mins.  No side effects so far. I can't wait to get the second dose. 

It was Pfizer/Biontec.

"I seriously need to rant! I don't understand the ""do your research"" argument.
The most LAZY and IGNORANT argument for those who are pro-covid-vaxx is ""do your research"". As if we haven't! Apparently they do not understand that true scientists are showing why all of this is concerning. We are given CONSTANT data that contradicts itself from BOTH SIDES. Bottom line, there has to be SOLID evidence that this vaxx is safe...and there just isn't. Period. End of story!",-1

I hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t had a GW flare up for several years but had one a few days after I received the first Pfizer vaccine. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m guessing that the vaccine lowered my immune system, has anyone else experienced this?",-1

"There is power in numbers!
Friday my workplace sent out an email saying that they were considering making the vaccine mandatory. I wrote to the CEO urging him not to make this decision, but I was sure that the writing was on the wall... I was anxious all weekend about what I would do if I was fired. 

Well, I guess I need to not give in to pessimism so easily because I just received an email saying that idea is no longer on the table! He received over a hundred replies in three days (in a company of about five hundred people). Not everyone was against the mandate but enough people were to change his mind.

"I got the first shot of the Pfizer covid vaccine today. Is this what hope feels like?
I got the coronavirus vaccine today.  I qualified due to having comorbidities.  All of which are well managed with medication and/or other interventions.

I had no choice over which one I got - although I knew it was going to be either Pfizer or Moderna.  Turns out it was Pfizer.  

When I was done, I'm not going to lie, I cried in my car for about 20 minutes.  After losing three family members and one friend due to coronavirus over the past year, I have been terrified of getting it for a whole straight year.  2020 was by far the worst year of my life.

I also am incredibly sick of people saying bullshit like, well they had other underlying conditions or they were old.  Or it only kills a small percentage of people.  Yeah and those people are still people that would still be alive today if it wasn't for coronavirus.  Plus 100 million Americans have an underlying condition.  I'm so sick of people being selfish assholes.

I still have to go back in three weeks for the second shot and I know the full protection from the vaccine won't kick in until about two weeks after the second shot, but I almost am beginning to feel like I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.  I honestly almost can't even remember what it feels like to have something positive happen.  Is this what hope feels like?",1
"Flying after testing positive (38 / jannson one-shot/ covid positive )
Hi everyone, well I'm positive, virtually completely recovered and a few days away from being able to leave quarantine. The vaccine certainly has done its thing, Covid  presented itself as a normal cold but with no sense of taste, 

I'm in the UK right now visiting family, I have a flight home to Colombia on the 7th, does anybody know where I can get entry requirements/ regs, I'm flying to Madrid and then connecting to Bogota.

I need to take that flight but I also don't want to be at an airport and told I'm now allowed to fly etc.  I have been told I can't take a PCR for the next 3 months, do you get a Drs note. 

 Who has had to fly after testing positive and recovering from it? What did you do? 

Thanks and I hope your all recovering well",1
"35 weeks and diagnosed with COVID
Help!
I am 35 weeks today and was just diagnosed with covid this morning. I felt crummy all weekend and went to work this morning but upon arrival I felt pretty dizzy and just not well.

"Not wanting to take the COVID-19 vaccine
So, Ive always been against the thought of taking the vaccine. My first reasons was: its not tested enough, Covid-19 is probably not gonna cause me to die (I am young) etc. But the more I think about it, the more I come to the conclusion that this has to do with being a ""survivor"" (dont know why but I dont like the word). I thought of myself as selfish for not wanting to take the vaccine, but I still wasnt gonna change my mind about it.

Having something injected in your body against your will is really what it comes to, and it reminds me of how powerless I felt as a child. I dont want to put my body through any more hardship and my whole body screams no about getting the vaccine. Maybe that will change one day but right now I am not taking the vaccine, I am not doing anything that my body does not want. I dont think other people that are not survivors can relate to this so I just wanted to post this here.",-1
"ACLU sees nothing wrong with vaccine mandates (regarding the covid vaccine)
I'm not positive if this is the best place to post this, but I feel like this could help those that are currently trying to talk to their Qfamily about the mandates. It also presents a very level-headed response to get vaccinated regardless of the mandate. The only unfortunate aspect is that it doesn't do anything to prevent the conspiratorial beliefs, so no promises that this will get through to those that have already been lost.

tl;dr: Because the vaccine protects others and promotes a faster return of our personal liberties to do what we want, how we want, and where we want, the mandate to get vaccinated promotes personal liberties, it doesn't restrict them. Read the article for the finer details.",1
"Anyone else here because of vaccine adverse effects? I was stupid enough to get both shots and my ears have been ringing non stop since the first shot. I've also had horrible nerve pain in my ears after the second shot.
The medical system gives no fucks about adverse reactions. I got permanent 24/7 tinnitus after the first shot and I got severe hyperacusis for 3 months after my second shot. A falling pencil felt like a stab in my ears. Sound would torture me and silence continues to torture me with tinnitus. The hyperacusis is bearable now but it's still really scary. Take at your own risk. Some people have had worse ear related long-term symptoms from the vaccine. They were Covid positive and the vaccine made it worse. No one will believe you or pay your bills for your adverse reactions and you will be called a stupid anti vaxxer for wishing they did more research before forcing you to take it. It’s your call, at your own risk. You’ll get the shot and no doctor will give a fuck about what comes after. I’ve been in a real dark place because of the vax. And I’ve taken both my shots so it’s fucked up they call us anti vaxxers when we are victims and willingly took the shots. They never believe you and tell you its all in your head, it’s so humiliating and messed up. I've had lots of vaccines all my life and none of them even poisoned me like this shit. Don't let any of your friends or family guilt you or take your choice. And definitely don't let the government force you to take an experimental vaccine",-1
"Got vaccinated 2 days back with Covid Shield. Here's my experience:
I got vaccinated in a private hospital for Rs.1100. The process was super smooth. Booked it through Cowin app.

1. Just after they gave me the vaccine my hand started shaking. I told them what was happening and they said wait for 15 min, if it still goes on then we'll see. After waiting for 10 min the hand had stopped shaking.

2. After waiting for 25 min at the hospital I was allowed to go, as I was going home I could feel my head getting heavier and heavier. By the time i reached home my head had started aching.

3. After 4 hours and an office meeting later I felt so thirsty, I drank 2 liters of buttermilk. I was feeling super hungry too hence ate more than what I usually do.

4. After 12 hours passed the headache had started receding. I felt good and thought side effects had gone but in the night my whole body started aching.

5. I woke up the next morning with slight fever(99ish) and body ache.

6. The body ache persisted the whole day while fever subsided by noon.

7. I can still feel some weakness and I'm eating more than usual.

**NOTE: Please get yourself and your near and dear ones vaccinated. I could easily work on both the days and side effects weren't too severe.**

I recently got my 2nd dose of Pfizer, two days ago. Me and my sister both have POTS and EDS, it hit my sister really hard and as I have a more severe version, I knew it most likely was going to hit me hard as well.

1st shot went wonderfully, just a sore arm for about two weeks (I got blood drawn on the same arm the same day so I knew it would be longer) but no major side effects

Anyway, on the 2nd shot I noticed it hurt a lot more.

First I developed a mild fever, and have had really bad nausea. I expected that though, and so it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t anything I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t deal with. 

Now I am dealing with extreme migraines upon standing, that are fully relieved once I lay down.

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not even sure how to describe it, but when I stand up my head gets a shooting pain and I get extremely bad brain fog and feel extremely ill.

Say when they draw blood or test? What if that's one tactic to target people who don't want the jab? Do it without their knowledge? Is that even possible or nah? I've heard some say yes and others no. What's your guys take?

I ask that because I foolishly got tested back in January when I got ""covid"" although it was more like a mild flu. And I know they drew blood and swabbed. But could it be possible they jabbed me? I don't remember that but idk.",-1

"if you're vaccinated in SC, your risk of getting COVID are equivalent to somebody who is not vaccinated here in New York state
Thanks neighbors and fellow South Carolinians!  From PBS News hour


""Vaccines are very good. They're very safe, very effective. If you have been vaccinated, your chances of ending up in the hospital or dying from COVID are really minimal. However, they're not perfect. And so it was to be expected we would see breakthrough infections, especially in places where we're seeing a lot of community transmission of the virus.  In South Carolina, for example, which has some of the highest rates of transmission in the country, if you're vaccinated, your risk of getting COVID are equivalent to somebody who is not vaccinated here in New York state. And that is simply because there is so much more virus circulating right now in South Carolina that, even with the protection of the vaccine, you could still get infected",1
"Vaccine side effects: brain blood clot
My father is 78 years old. He got his second shot of Pfizer in april. Exactly two weeks later, he suffered three attacks in 48 hours caused by brain clots,  and spent 5 days in the hospital.

He has mostly recovered now, he's quite strong for his age, and had no problems whatsoever of this kind before.

You know what's most shocking to me ? When I went to visit him at the hospital, I talked to the doctor who has taking care of him. I asked him if the blood clots could be related to the vaccine. The good doctor shrugged it off and told me that it could not under any circumstances be caused by the vaccine.

So of course this was never counted as a possible side effect, and I'm sure that there are many such cases. It's obvious that if you don't look out for them, there will be no side effects at all.

My country has no VAERS system, so it will never be counted. As for myself, there's no way I'll get the jab.",-1
"Get the COVID vaccine.please


IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m going to explain this:

Even if most of the population is vaccinated, and even if only a small % of the population doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get vaccinated, those people may still get COVID, and because of that, COVID could mutate within those unvaccinated people and mutate to be resistant against the vaccine, rendering the vaccine pointless and making everyone open to getting COVID.

Basically if ppl donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get the vaccine, the virus could mutate to be able to bypass the current vaccine, and infect ppl with the vaccine, and kill more people.

In total: yes itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a personal choice, but your ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœpersonal choiceÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â affects a fuck ton of other people. So get vaccinated for fucks sake, especially because people with cancer  or other diseases could get sick again from COVID and could die.

"A message for all the tourist lately
You're here to ridicule us and argue on the name of science that other people have done, meaning whatever science you are preaching you take as the truth based on FAITH. Well most of us noticed that what they say and what we have experienced the last 2 year do not match. So we think they are full of shit. Why do you act like there is no immoral people in the science community? That's not what I want to talk about. This post is for Americans. Even if all the science was concrete and fact, it would not matter. This is about principle to most of us. Jefferson once said ""those who would trade liberty for security deserve neither"" what you people don't understand is that we see a much larger threat than the virus. We see fascism and excuses for condoning it. You guys have places to go that are just like the system you're asking for. Places like China where you would be forced to be vaccinated and people like us couldn't say what we say because social credit system incentives and penalties. Ok?. So you guys have places to go that fit your ideals. We don't. This is the home of the brave and land of the free (not land of the weak and home of the slave) . And no red blooded American is afraid of some bullshit virus they can't even see OR HAS NOT BEEN ISOLATED AKA PROVING IT EXISTS.  We are afraid of leaving our children a orwellian dystopia. Our fathers and our the fathers before them have died for this land and what it stands for. Nothing will make me take that in vain and I would do the very same for my children and my children's children. I'm telling you right now, we are not abandoning our ideals so you can feel safe. When the science is sound and I feel OK with the pros and cons I may THINK about it. But with the the shaming and the lying media, calling me a fucking murder??  Not happening. The government and its branches, big pharama and the media (AKA 4th branch) has acquired too much power and are clearly over reaching. This is our fight.

Hi all I was initially very worried about taking the vaccine having been floxed and just overall skeptical about pharma in general (as most of us are) but I finally took the plunge.

Started to feel a little off that eveningÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â”nothing terrible, but I could tell my immune system was kicking into high gear. I fell asleep early but woke up a few times during the night because my arm hurt so bad. I felt pretty crappy the next morning and had a bad headache. I started to feel better around 24hrs after and took my dog on our normal walk. I felt good doing it but then came home and took a long nap. I had a hard time sleeping again because my arm pain woke me up any time I moved but I woke up feeling okay Sunday. By 48hrs the only symptoms I had was a sore arm and feeling stiff from laying on the couch all weekend. 

As far as GP symptoms, I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t see any change. I have been figuring out ways to better handle it with diet, exercise, and managing stress, but still had an episode when I dared to put something in my mouth past 8pm the other day. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t think the vaccine had an impact either time for me. 

My main recommendations are to stay hydrated the best you can (nuun tablets are my favorite) and take extra good care of yourself a few days before so your immune system is ready. Move your arm as much as you can right afterwards to minimize the pain. I took ibuprofen after (from what IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve read you should avoid taking nsaids before) to manage my headache. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve had a brain tumor removed so I have a high tolerance for headaches but it definitely met the threshold for some mild painkillers. My friend got her first dose yesterday was told to avoid nsaids altogether for the days after. I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t seen any research on that yet and I was actually told to use ibuprofen to manage any symptoms. Hopefully there will be a clearer message on that for the future because not taking anything for pain relief would have made me nauseated. 

Hopefully this is helpful and that everyone who is able to get a vaccine strongly considers doing it! Despite not feeling great I would do it again in a heartbeat.",1
"BCG scar red after COVID vaccine
24F, 160cm, 50kg, Caucasian, on birth control, occasionally drink alcohol.

Yesterday I got my first shot of the Moderna vaccine. For the rest of the day, I had a very sore arm ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” which was expected. Took a painkiller in the evening, that didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t help.

Today I woke up with my BCG scar area red and tender. Is that a normal reaction or something to be worried about? 

On the picture you can see a light bruise where the needle went in, my BCG scar is a few cm away.

"French Government to open 7000 vaccination centers in schools
&gt; The French government has announced that it will massively vaccinate children.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus it was announced that from September onwards nearly 7000 vaccination centers will be opened directly in schools in order to allow the vaccination of children  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, the government has stated that minors could be vaccinated without the consent of their parents.  
&gt;  
&gt;In parallel to this law, the government has conducted a huge influence campaign via partnerships with influencers appreciated by children.  
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, advertising spots tell young children that they must get vaccinated if they don't want to be responsible for their grandparents' deaths by infecting them.   
&gt;  
&gt;As a reminder, if parents refuse to vaccinate their children they could be prosecuted for violating ""legal obligations that compromise the health, morals or education"" of their child.

"My two cents about the rise of sudden deaths
It has been some time since I started to check local news for sudden and unexplainable deaths. I've seen everything: 40 years old workers dropping dead on workplace, women in their 30s dying at the restaurant, cars crashing because the driver had a stroke, cyclists and now people at the beach. 
I premise that in my opinion the studies about the dangers of the spike protein make sense because side effects of vaccines are the same worrying symptoms of covid (flu aside) but the virus isn't even present, only the spike!

That said, I'd like to hear your opinion about my hypothesis: 
An unknown number of people develop myocarditis after the vaccine. The problem can be asymptomatic so the affected doesn't realize something is wrong.
Then after each fatiguing activity (sports, swimming at the beach/stay under the hot sun for too much, working for example in a factory and so on) the damaged heart worsens a little, untill it  can't take it any more and the next activity that requires some more pumping effort becomes the last straw.
At that point BAM! Heart attack.

This would explain the sudden deaths for infarction imho.",-1

"COVID-19 Vaccine and Migraine
I was lucky enough to get the Covid vaccine as teachers have just been able to in my state. I got it last Friday and since then I have had a migraine every single day ranging from mild to severe. I still recommend getting the vaccine because it is obviously better than getting Covid or giving it to someone else. 

I get Botox injections in my head, forehead, jaw, and neck. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not sure if the vaccine is stirring up my auto immune system or the Botox is being attacked by the vaccine. Whatever it is IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been really sick and havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t been able to work for the whole week. Tonight IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been able to get on my phone and post this just in case anybody needs to plan accordingly and may be prepared to take some time off work if they can. 

I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t recommend getting the vaccine right after getting the Botox treatments if you do because it might have a interaction that they havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t had reported yet on a larger scale.

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve had the bodyaches fever and chills etc. but as we migraine sufferers know that this is bearable. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s unpleasant but we can still go on with our day. But the migraine is something that really canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœpushed through.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â

ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s going to be a really rough two months not having any Botox because my insurance wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t pay for more injections. I do have a sumatriptan but if I take that more than a few times a week it becomes ineffective.

I am 38(F), and have had migraines since I was about 8-9, chronic migraines starting about two years ago. The Botox has helped a lot. I only have migraines a few times a week now. Going back to you every day has been very emotionally distressing and demoralizing as I had just started to take on more students in my tutoring practice.

"Let's use Pro-Choice and Anti-Choice in the context of the COVID Vaccine

They are even encouraging pregnant women on taking a vaccine that has lots of reports of disruption on menstrual cycles, while already approved vaccines are not even prescribed for pregnant women.

**Of course some of us are vaccinated, others are not, but the key is choice.**

Some people may die because 2% of vaccinations do not help, but overall [0.003-0.007% death rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/) is no excuse to take away basic human rights and liberties... specially if you are already vaccinated (There is even less risk for children!). Cars, alcohol and sugar consumption would be banned from long time ago if we used the COVID logic on everything. *Let's ban sugar until diabetes deaths decrease by 20%*.

What about death from suicides because lockdowns and isolation? What about thr next years of distress, depression and shitty life because of this?

"We are not the minority.
I hope everyone reading this is keeping their heads up. The only way they are getting away with this massive brainwashing scheme is with social media (with the help of algorithms and obedient citizens) and MSM. 

The reality is, less than 20% of the population is vaccinated. 

The reality is, most people donâ€™t even have the privilege of accessing a vaccine yet. 

The reality is, many people who do have the privilege are exercising their choice not to get it. 

Every time I go outside Iâ€™m shocked. When I go to walk my dog, I would guess I see 1/8 people wearing a mask outside. Itâ€™s actually rare to see it, despite the mask ordinances. 

Last week I went to Oakland and I visited Lake Merrit which since 2020 has become basically an open air market for all sorts of things. **70% of people were not wearing a mask, not wearing one correctly, or halfway dangling them off their faces**. I was astonished. I even seen an anti mask parade, people passing out flyers warning people about the â€œvaccineâ€ (with all factual info), people holding up signs saying â€œshow me your smileâ€ and â€œthanks for not wearing a maskâ€. I seen a woman passing out slips of paper questioning the logic of masks.  The people who were wearing masks just politely filtered through the crowd, shopping, sightseeing and hanging out with their friends. I had only positive interactions with them. This is in California of all places. 

I seen something similar in Californiaâ€™s capitol, Sacramento, (people freely out and about, mingling, not really wearing masks and enjoying life). 

I could not believe my eyes. Iâ€™ve been staying inside a lot this past year, because frankly the world seems to have gone crazy and I donâ€™t want any parts. The fact that people are being essentially black listed on my Facebook homepage and twitter feed for saying they donâ€™t want the vaccine, the fact that â€œanti vaxxersâ€ are being labeled and a narrative is being pushed by MSM, the fact that there is this weird ostracizing thing happening, is just another tool to brainwash people. Most people are not really going for this, even in California. They might just not be fighting back that hard yet. 

The thing is, the people I know who have gotten vaccinated, are the same people that I seen flouting the restrictions all last year. They werenâ€™t all hiding out in their homes and having no contact with their friends. People were still hooking up and casually dating. I seen people going to parties. I also see them posting â€œCovid is realâ€ and virtue signaling on social media even though I see them stretching the rules in life or in their photos (not social distancing, wearing their masks improperly, leaving their house, being photographed with people who arenâ€™t wearing a mask, celebrating thanksgiving, getting their nails done). These are the same people I see 6 months later posting and encouraging people to get the shot, chastising â€œconspiracy theoristsâ€ and promoting public health community outreach efforts. 

I donâ€™t think these people are afraid of Covid at all. They just want to go back to normal and are willing to do whatever the government says for it. They want to conform and fit in with the crowd, as theyâ€™ve always done, and avoid being the outcasts of society. They donâ€™t want to talk about their hesitancy with the vaccines or the questions they have with the narrative because theyâ€™re afraid of getting singled out by their peers and shunned/doxxed. Some join in openly disparaging the people that question the narrative, even a little bit, making the people who are even more afraid to speak up. 

People seem to be more afraid of each other than they are the government or covid. 

I feel like the type of people who donâ€™t believe in forcing people to wear masks or forcing them to take an experimental drug are also the type of people that donâ€™t feel like forcing their opinions or choices down the throat of others. They live and let live. They are also probably not on social media all day. The ones who are indoors and love these draconian practices and want more, are the ones driving the social media narrative thatâ€™s dominating the voices of the vast majority of people. Couple that with shadowbanning and censorship and you have a recipe for the ultimate social media marketing scheme. 

How many people even have twitter or ig accounts and are active on them? Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a lot, but how many compared to the population in the US? How many of those accounts are real people? When has the dominating cultural/social attitude on these social media sites ever been reflective of reality? 

My point is that theyâ€™re not and I see this every time I go outside. If you were really that scared of Covid, if nine members of your family dropped dead of it, I canâ€™t imagine you being willing to take the risk of contracting it by going outside to do non essential activities. I would think someone like that would stay inside and talk shit about everyone else thatâ€™s out. The people out enjoying life are too busy to tweet about and donâ€™t want the conflict that comes with it if someone confronts them for it. 

Stay hopeful friends. Go outside, enjoy the weather and live your lives. We are not the minority.",-1

"CMV: I solely blame the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic in America on anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers.
As of the creation of this post, the US now sees about 2000 deaths per day due to Covid-19. We havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t seen this many deaths per day since March, and with the delta variant of the virus spreading, weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re starting to regress as far as getting over this pandemic is concerned. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re starting to go back to the point where schools are closing again, businesses are being forced to limit themselves and the people they serve, mask mandates, basically weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re going back to the kind of limitations and restrictions that we had to work around with during the beginning stages of the pandemic. 

The culprit behind the rise in Covid-19 cases, deaths, and the subsequent reactions is due to the tens of millions of people that refuse to get the Covid-19 vaccine and refuse to wear a mask in settings where theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re around multiple people. The vast majority of people being hospitalized and dying of Covid-19 are unvaccinated, and now itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s getting to the point where theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve overburdened hospitalÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s quite badly.

So with that being said, I completely blame every anti-vaxxer and anti-masker for the current state of the pandemic. This is all their fault. If these people had just worn masks like they were told to without being stubborn assholes and gotten the vaccine months ago when they became widely available, this pandemic would have been greatly reduced and we would be on the back end of it, perhaps even eliminating it. Every person that refuses the vaccine and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t wear a mask when required to is part of the problem, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m tired of pretending that they have a point or could be half right.

"Is it a lack of faith if you get the covid vaccine?
I got my first dose of the vaccine two weeks ago and it was something that I was nervous about due to everything IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d see online. However, I did it anyways to be safe.


My boyfriend, who is also a Christian, was really disappointed in me. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not an anti vaxxer but heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a strong anti covid vaxxer lol. He said I was terrible for doing that to him because he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want me to die and overall just very disappointed. What hurt me the most is that he said that I lack faith in God for getting it, that I should be trusting God and not the vaccine. He said that it was like if Peter first got floaties before attempting to walk on the water. He keeps saying how disappointed he is I lacked faith in God. 

I already got COVID once and spread it to my mom and dad and I saw how terrible it can be firsthand, I just wanted to minimize something like that ever happening again.",1
"Debilitating long term joint pain after COVID vaccine - Vitamin D deficiency?

I (29F) received the first dose Moderna on April 2 and after 2-3 days I had the worst joint pain in every joint to the point where the weight of my blanket had me in pain. The worst joints were my ankles and knees with my ankles swelling up on week 2. 

It has now been over a month and I still have joint pain, only 800mg of ibuprofen gets me through the day. Sometimes my fingers and toes get almost stuck in one position. 

The doctor said I had low vitamin D with a level of 23 where the normal range is 30-90, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been taking 4000 units of vit d and also magnesium and a multivitamin and nothing has gotten better. My knees now pop more and sometime crackle and get stuck in painful positions. 

My big toe is also numb on one side. 

11 days after my first dose of vaccine I took a COVID antibody test and had Igg antibodies but no Igm 

I just have a hard time believing a vitamin d deficiency can cause this level of pain and the coincidence with the vaccine is weird.

Hi guys! Yesterday morning i just had my 1st Pfizer shot. I've been suffering with terrible arm pain, it still hurts today, but today i woke up with sore throat. I usually get a sore throat before a flu...

I know covid spreads through droplets of infected saliva. Me and my husband go out of the house rarely, maybe 2 times per week, and only late in the night, when there are no people around. We are lucky to have a supermarket right in front of our house that is open 24/24 and if we need to buy something, we go in the middle of the night, when there are no people. We wear our masks, never touch our faces with our hands, use sanitizer and wash hands very well when we get home. We get most of our groceries delivered home.

I think it is very unlikely to have gotten covid, considering all of these info. Is it possible that my sore throat is a vaccine side effect?",0

I have a family member who isn't full blown Q as far as I know but is definitely Q adjacent. He's anti COVID vax and thinks the impact of the virus is overblown.

Body aches, cough, a low fever, and lost his sense of taste, but didn't require any treatment aside from rest. This has only emboldened him in his stance against the vaccine and any mitigation measures at all.

Now the german government is talking about the pandemic of the unvaccinated too. 

This is to counter the argument that everyone who wants to protect himself can now take the vaccine and we can end all of this.

Germanys ""table"" (food for the poor) now only gives food out for people with the pass before the government even put it in law. And when tests become chargeable, the poor either have to get vaccinated or don't get food from ""table"" anymore. 

Meanwhile in france the greenpass started. Tests won't stay free for much longer, and it will be extended to children 12years and older. They want 100% of the kids vaccinated.

"Migraines triggered by COVID vaccine?
About 6 weeks ago I got my first does of the Moderna Covid vaccine. A day or two after I started noticing dull headaches, which I didn't think much of at first because it was an expected side effect. Since then, however, I've had a headache pretty much every day. They start out as a dull 3-4/10 pain when I wake up, and by the time I go to bed most days I can't look at my phone, watch TV, or see any other source of light without intense and/or throbbing pain. The last night few nights I've been going to bed with icepacks on my foreheads and eyes.

I did go ahead and get the second dose after 4 weeks as scheduled, and in the two weeks since that the headaches have continued pretty much as they were before. I've been trying to avoid taking OTC painkillers as much as possible to avoid rebound headaches, and have been heavily limiting screen time in the evenings. Unfortunately I work on a computer all day so that's pretty much impossible from 9-5.

"The Un Vaxxed creating variants
So hearing more and more rhetoric about the unvaccinated are creating the variants. Did some Google searching and can't find any science or studies about this. I see talking heads and so called ""experts"" on television stating that the unvaxxed are to blame for the variants but I never hear any science actually discussed. 

Has anyone successfully found any science behind this? 

My understanding based on my reading is that a virus infects it host ( which it does to vaccinated people as well ) and is always attempting to make itself more transmissable, not necessarily more deadly.

So with the CDC NOT recommending testing for vaccinated individuals or tracking breakthrough cases, wouldn't it be impossible for them to know who caused the variants? Furthermore, if the vaccinated can catch and spread covid aren't they equally responsible for any variants?

Any argument to say that their are less breakthrough cases for covid is irrelevant, since the CDC knew from the trail data that vaccinated individuals can get covid.

So, I had no reluctance in getting the covid vaccine, nor did my primary care provider. 

I had shot #1 (Pfizer) with no issues. A few weeks ago, I had shot #2. Three days after, I had full body very itchy hives that took 2.5 days to subside. My GBS residual effects (neuropathy in my legs) became much worse after the hives subsided though solved with an increase in the medication I take for it. My PCP thinks the reaction is likely due to my immune system getting activated as a result of the vaccine but I have no real idea.

Of course, it could also be something completely unrelated.

"/u/TwoScoopsBaby on Are you getting the Covid shot?
I have received both doses of the Moderna vaccine.

mRNA vaccines were conceived of like twenty years ago and have undergone a great deal of testing, although I believe this is the first case in which this type of vaccine was used on humans. The mRNA that went into my arm was taken up by a ribosome inside my cells and that ribosome translated the mRNA into a protein that my immune system identified as foreign. In response, my immune system built antibodies (defense proteins) to destroy the foreign protein. If the coronavirus gets into my body now, my antibodies will destroy it quickly since they are already circulating in my bloodstream.

By the time I had received my first dose, thousands of people had participated in clinical trials, and millions more had received their vaccines ""in the wild."" This enabled me to realize I was not a guinea pig for this particular situation.

"My Covid journey ""update"" and my first vaccine.
Hello fellow redditors! I made a post back on May that I had unfortunately tested + for Covid.  I had every symptom as it ran its course for approximately 21 days. Once my fever broke, around day 10 or 11, I began to improve drastically each day.  As of today, I still do not have taste or smell. Other than that, I feel fine. I have lost approximately 40 pounds since I tested positive (lack of taste and smell makes me hardly eat and the random depressing/psychological effects etc). When I caught Covid, I was not vaccinated. I wore a mask diligently and followed all guidelines.  I believe I caught it at work, as I am a waitress on the Vegas strip and see hundreds of people a day. 

A week ago, July 19th, I got my first shot of Pfzier . I was pretty scared since I had had Covid on how my body would react to the shot. I felt nothing when I got the shot, it was super quick and painless. I got it at 1 PM. By 2:30 PM, my arm began to feel sore, nothing terrible. By 6 PM, I felt like I needed a nap and arm soreness increased. I fought the urge to nap at that time and I took some ibuprofen for my arm. At approximately 8:45 PM, I went to sleep. When I woke up on Wednesday morning, I felt fine but my arm was pretty damn sore. Took more ibuprofen and went about my day. Wednesday evening, again around 6 PM, I was exhausted.  By 9 PM, I was in bed. While in bed, I began to get a headache, some body chills/fever going back and forth. If I'm being honest, for a second I thought ""Oh no! This is how I felt when I first got Covid!"" But I took more ibuprofen and tried to think how happy how I was to finally be vaccinated. I fell asleep and upon waking up Thursday AM, I was 100% (as far as vaccine side effects). My second dose is scheduled August 10, so I will update you guys then! 

I just wanted to share my experience, as I know many people who had Covid may be weary about getting the shot because they've heard the side effects can be much worse. In my experience, there were side effects. But, I personally, would have rather had those side effects than to ever get covid again. I hope someone out there finds this useful and any questions, please ask. Thanks to this sub for all the support and easing my mind when I did test + in May.",1

Being brave and healthy only gets you so far if it’s stage 2 of the bioweapon/radiation attack. I wouldn’t care if I wasn’t a mother, it really changes everything.

"Proponents of Covid Conspiracies: What about Long Covid?
First of all, I'm not here to belittle anyone's beliefs. I'm an open-minded person, even with conspiracy theories, and I'm open to anything. And while I have been double vaccinated, and encourage others to do the same, I am not here to enforce that on others. Please do not attack me for this post.

My question is this: If Covid-19 is non-serious, as many on here seem to suggest, then how does one explain the phenomenon of 'long Covid', which is a mysterious post-infection disease which causes effects that last months, and may even last years or potentially life. These effects include fatigue, lung problems, cognition problems,  diabetes, baldness, heart problems, kidney problems, chronic pain, and more.

This idea scared the crap out of me, frankly. It was probably the primary reason I got vaccinated (outside of the fact that, in Australia, you pretty much HAVE to get vaccinated). Why do people not want to take the vaccine, something that *might* cause long-term problems, yet are seemingly not afraid to get Covid-19, something which definitely *can* cause long-term problems?

Once again, not attacking anyone's beliefs. But if someone who believes in Covid conspiracies could explain their logic for this, it would be great.

"Getting the Covid vax after being raised with anti-vax values
I was raised in an extremely anti-big-pharma household, with a major distrust for vaccines. This stemmed from my mother, who has spent the last two years ensuring I don’t get the vaccine because ‘she doesn’t want me to die, and she also wants grandbabies.’ 

I bit the bullet and secretly got the first Pfizer vax, which made me extremely anxious. Honestly, I’m not even that anxious about the way it could affect me, I’m just so worried about how my mother would react if I had an adverse reaction. 

She sends me several links a day to stories about people who suffered horrific side effects, and often mentions how betrayed she would feel if I ever got the vax. 

Whilst I don’t align with my mother on this issue, and I recognise how harmful her views are, I can’t help but feel extremely guilty. I have my second dose tomorrow and I can’t stop crying, because I’ve read that many adverse reactions occur after the second vax.

"I feel like I'm being pressured not to take the COVID-19 vaccine.
This might sound a bit ridiculous, but yesterday, I was watching a science video. I scrolled down to the comments expecting a nice discussion. Most comments were telling you not to take the vaccine, surprisingly. I looked at the replies, and they were saying that any sane person would know that the vaccine is dangerous, and we are being pressured everywhere and brainwashed to take the vaccine.

That made me feel down for a while, since everyone was agreeing with the comments, I started to think I was insane. All these stories about people supposedly dying from the vaccine... I always wanted to take the vaccine, and my relative assured me that the vaccine was safe, and told me to stop scrolling down to the comments.

People say that the vaccine was made too fast, and a normal one takes 10 years. Wouldn't so many people get it or possibly die if it was 5-10 years? Just look what happened in just 1 year! What about 10 times that? We would start saying that the apocalypse has come.

A lot of us aren't scared of the virus, but are extremely paranoid of the vaccine itself. I don't even understand. Yes, there are side effects, but you probably won't die from it.

Of course, many people are currently getting the vaccine, but I feel like I just blindly supported it before, almost as if I was actually brainwashed.

Weird feelings after Pfizer vaccine. Is it normal?

Hi everyone, I had my second Pfizer jab on Tuesday. 24 hours after the jab I had some weird sensations behind my knee on my right leg, it was painless, and then my left thigh started to feel like it was pulsating a little bit shortly later, again pretty painless. Now Thursday again behind my knee on my right knee it feels weird. Again a weird sensation, not painful or anything but different and somewhat annoying. Makes me leg feel heavy whilst lying down. However when moving around today during work I did not notice it, in fact I only notice it when I lie down in bed.

So what do you guys think? Anything to be concerned about? Do I get checked out for blood clots? Or is that unlikely? Is this just muscle pain as advertised may happen.

Not anti vaccine but heard of a guy locally die from a blood clot due to Jansen injection (ages only 23) recently. I was delighted to receive my Pfizer shots but I am trying to be overcautious rather than laughing it off just to make sure nothing bad happens. If something could be wrong I want to act ASAP. As itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s late I thought a Reddit post might help. Thanks &lt;3",0

"TIFU by getting a COVID vaccine
Preface: to make it absolutely clear ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” vaccines are safe, harmless and you should absolutely get vaccinated. If you are trying to abuse my story to promote your anti-vaxx propaganda, you can go \*\*\* yourself.

Just happened an hour ago, I'm still trying to process it.

So, I went to a local vaccination center to get my first COVID vaccine. It's this big hall, everything organized very professionally, military guards, hundreds of people being processed. I line up, everything easy, short chat with the medical personnel, everything in order, they sit me down, I get the injection, no biggie. Then I am asked to go sit in this common hall with a bunch of other people for observation. I can leave after 10 minutes they say.

So I sit down, take my phone, browse Reddit, you know, the usual stuff to kill some time. Then I realize that I am a bit dizzy. Just a little bit, not a big deal, so I brush it off. As time goes on though, I am getting more and more dizzy. I start thinking that I might have an allergic reaction or something. After 10 minutes I am *very* dizzy and my heart is racing like crazy. So I get the attention of the nearby medical personnel and tell them I don't feel that good. They ask if I want to talk to a doctor. Yeah, maybe I say. We'll fetch a wheelchair they say. Oh, there is no need, I reply, I can walk. So I stand up and... kind of crash to the ground. Not a real fall but my legs don't hold me that well. I am really dizzy now, my stomach is all stone, and I start getting these weird electrical shocks though my body. Ugh, not good, I catch myself thinking.

They pick me up, put me in the wheelchair and rush me to the emergency room, with roughly a hundred puzzled and worried mostly elderly people looking on (for reference, I am close to 2 meters tall guy in my mid 30-s, so it must have looked a bit weird). I am on a medical bed and I feel *reallyreally* crappy, there is a huge weight on my chest and I have difficulty breathing. They are hooking me to a bunch of medical machines. My life is flashing in front of my eyes. What a crappy way to go I think and wait for the seemingly inevitable premature demise to come.

""Your blood pressure is really low, but the heart is in perfect condition"" ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” I hear the doctor say. Wait, what? So I am not dying? She laughs. ""No, you are fine, probably just an overreaction of the autonomic nervous system"". Oh. The pressure from my chest suddenly disappears, I just feel very weak and quite embarrassed. So I'm ok? ""Pretty much in great shape yeah, just a bit low blood pressure, its fairly common reaction to seeing a needle. Did you eat anything today?"". Oh, I think, shouldn't have skipped that breakfast and lunch probably. The feeling of impending doom is quickly replaced by the feeling of extreme embarrassment. I am not having an anaphylactic shock or a heart attack. I am just having an anxiety attack from being pricked by a needle in an unfamiliar environment. Awkward.

Twenty minutes later they escort me out of the building, joking about how they are thankful for having a reason to actually do something instead of standing around all day. I am super red, bowing in the best of the Japanese fashion (I am neither Japanese nor this was in Japan) and apologizing like crazy. They wink me good bye and tell me ""see you in four weeks"". I go grab some sweets and drinks, feeling like a massive idiot.

P.S. A bit shoutout for the medical team for their professionalism, kindness and a great sense of humor. They really did an amazing job and I was deeply impressed about how calm and efficient they stayed though the entire episode. You ladies and gentlemen rock!

P.P.S. Since there were some ""concerns"" about this story I would like to clarify that this is a throw-away account (I don't want my friends and family to know my real Reddit identity). I also tried to post the story multiple times since I had an issue with the bot auto-rejecting my post for formatting issues.

TL;DR got my vaccine shot, had a surprise light vasovagal reaction (sudden blood pressure drop because of anxiety), interpreted it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine itself, which triggered a massive panic attack. Thought I was dying, got wheeled away by the on-duty doctor team, who proceeded to poke friendly jokes at me. Walked out in perfect health and a very red face not half hour later, with my pride and sense of manliness utterly destroyed forever.",1

"I hate this 'new normal'
I know this has been mentioned countless of times, but I still can't help but cringe at this term. I recently called a mental health hotline, and the person on the phone actually used this phrase on me and told me that ""I just have to adapt to life as it is now because we will never return to pre-pandemic life"". I cannot even begin to explain how much that triggered me. Is this really the way we are going to live our lives from now on? Will we never be able to stop wearing masks, or travel without having to quarantine? These were supposed to be temporary measures just to curb the spread of this virus, but now there are people who genuinely believe and want this way of life to go on forever??

I cannot imagine myself living a life where offices don't exist and everyone works from home. I cannot imagine schools being conducted over Zoom, or gyms and dance studios requiring safe distancing forever. I feel like I am the only person who cannot move on from the memories of pre-pandemic era, and everyone else seems have adapted to this current way of life and accepted things as they are. The world is in such a mess right now, and everything just seems so bleak and depressing. Nowadays, whenever I watch shows depicting normal life (people hanging out with friends without masks, having team discussions in the office, going to a movie or concert etc.), I just can't believe that the last time I did those things was in 2019. If life is going to be like this forever and this 'new normal' nonsense persists, I don't know what I'm living in this world for anymore. Everyone tells me that I should just make the best of the situation, and aim for partial normality/do as many activities as the current situation permits. Am I wrong to say that that is not enough for me? I don't want partial normality, or ""some semblance"" of freedom. I want my freedom back. I want the old normal, the life we used to have where we can go out and socialise with others without restrictions, where there was a set routine for work and school.

I feel like nothing can reassure me anymore. They said vaccines will be the way out of it, but the rate of vaccination is so slow and there are so many stubborn people who refuse to get it. Not to mention the recent article published in the UK that the Delta variant causes the same amount of virus in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. And then there are so many debates about vaccine passports, mask mandates, international travel bans, freedom of choice for vaccination etc. It truly feels like the world is in a mess and society is so segregated because of COVID issues, that the spillover effects of this pandemic may last forever. Businesses have folded, entire industries (especially travel) have been halted for more than a year, and so many people are unemployed. People kept saying last year that this would be over in Fall 2021, but it certainly does not seem to be over now. Now WHO is saying end of 2022. I really wish they would stop shifting the goal post and do something about this already. I know things change and we must roll with the punches, but this is all too much. Will we ever live a normal life again?",0
"Stop pretending that you're powerless.
I'm not a big poster, I used to be before my old account got shadow banned. Now I just lurk. The main thing I've been seeing lately is people acting like they are just powerless to all this and they're just complaining instead of making a real stand. It doesn't have to be major, you don't have to make an ass out of yourself but you have to make a stand otherwise you might as well be pro-forced vax. For instance, I don't even take a mask with me into public anymore, if a business wants me to wear a mask, I just leave. No fuss or arguments, just leave. This obviously isn't detrimental to large businesses but small ones will take note of this and will think hard about enforcing this every time someone turns around and leaves. Servers will start to wonder how many tips they're missing out on by turning away mask-less people. These people only understand money and this wont change if you just keep paying these people who hate you. It's so simple that I almost feel stupid saying it.

"Update: Got my first Covid shot today!
Hi folks, 

A few days back I asked if you all would be curious to hear my experience getting dose one of the two dose covid vaccine (at the time, I didn't know if it would be Pfizer or Moderna). Here is the link to that post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ankylosingspondylitis/comments/m1xyq0/getting\_the\_covid\_vaccine\_this\_saturday\_anyone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ankylosingspondylitis/comments/m1xyq0/getting_the_covid_vaccine_this_saturday_anyone/)

Well, today I got dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine! I am fortunate to live in a state where educators are eligible. 

I must admit that I was a little scared going into the appointment because I have heard such a wide range of different experiences from my autoimmune friends, and from folks on this subreddit. 

**In short, my experience was positive with dose one, and I hope you will find it reassuring**. For context, I experience low grade fevers, joint pain (back pain of course LOL), and fatigue on a daily basis like many of you. Therefore, I cannot be entirely sure if my symptoms are fully related to vaccine, or to my body just doing its own thing.

So far, I have a pretty noticeable pain in the injection site. The feeling is similar to getting hit with a baseball. It is a strong, localized pain. I started to feel it within an hour of getting the shot. It is completely manageable and I am currently sitting at my desk and grading papers despite the pain. I also feel tired. However, fatigue is a constant part of my life, so I do not know if I can attribute it to the shot. I would not say that I am more or less tired than usual- just tired, if that makes sense. I also have a low grade fever and my whole body feels hot to the touch. I am honestly fine and feel well equipped to deal with these minor symptoms.

"A Word on COVID Posts and Comments
At my own discretion, based purely on whatever I feel like at the moment, it is going to be the position of the benevolent Dictatorship that is this Reddit sub, that misinformation (as defined by me) about COVID will be corrected and/or deleted and those who continue to post it will be banned. 

If you are going to have a problem with this, I recommend that you take your COVID posts to some other sub. There are plenty. 

You may post links (as long you donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get carried away) to whatever ridiculous information you want, but if automod deletes it (probably due to it coming from a disreputable web site) I will not correct it. 

Facts:

Because a person can be infected with the virus for some time without showing symptoms, it is critical that we all act as if we are infected at all times. This means wearing a mask, no drinking after others, washing your hands, and keeping as much distance as possible: even if you are vaccinated. 

Masks of any kind slow the spread of all airborne infection, including COVID. Higher quality masks have a better outcome but any mask is better than none. **Masks lessen the rate at which an infected wearer spreads the infection.** To a lesser degree, masks protect the wearer from infection. 

Hand washing and social distancing will lessen the chances of getting infected or of infecting others. 

Vaccination lowers the chance of infection, decreases the impact of infection if it does occur, and improves the overall outcomes of society as a whole. 

As with any vaccination, those taking the vaccine take on a risk for a benefit to society in an act of bravery. 

It is possible that the vaccines will have side effects, some short term which are generally known and there may be long term effects we have not seen yet. The odds of getting harmed by COVID are far greater than of being harmed by a vaccination against COVID. The math is dramatically in favor of getting vaccinated.

**This information will almost certainly change.** The best information we have changes as our knowledge improves. This is how Science works. It should not be surprising. 

 If you disagree with this information: keep it to yourself or post it on another sub. The misinformation people keep posting here is dangerous and while I do not police content in general, I am making an exception for COVID misinformation.",1

People have every right to be sceptical and make their own decisions regarding a vaccine that has been created in record speed where no one knows what the future side effects may be. It’s not the same as not vaccinating your child for mumps, measles and whatever other serious diseases one gets vaccinated for. These are proven and tested. I am getting the vaccine and think people should get it but it seems like using the term ‘anti-vaxx’ is a way of politicising and branding someone as crazy if they so much as date to ponder possible side effects. I don’t believe people should be demonised for considering not taking a vaccine that the future effects of are not known.",-1
"Does paracetamol blunt the immunity brought on by COVID-19 vaccine?
Hi! 24F here, Asian, 5'6, 130 pounds, previous history of Covid-19 infection (June 2021). 

Was reading online and read that taking a painkiller before the vaccine is a big no-no. But what about after? I was worried a paracetamol might lessen the effects of the vaccine on me, but after my 1st Moderna dose, my side effects were so bad, I took one. I still experienced pretty bad side effects though. 

My second dose wasn't as bad but I did develop a slight fever. I didn't want to take paracetamol but my mom, who was taking care of me, was really concerned and made me take two. Still had mild side effects after, but definitely not as bad as the first. Now I'm worried about efficacy. Does paracetamol blunt the immunity brought on by the vaccine?",0
"The unvaxxed people are really the reason of why the virus keeps on mutating?
I don't want to get vaccinated for many reasons.
But my friends tell me people like me are the reason of the virus mutating fast and getting stronger.
And I don't know what to respond. 

I've read news articles saying unvacced people are variant factories and it seems like people believe it. 
Is there a proof? I think it's the opposite, but I have no proof.",-1

"The vaccine will fail when the side effects become obvious, we just need to wait it out
This is a siege, we are under attack. The worst thing we can do is give in, to win we just need patience and resolve.

They only need us to lapse a moment to defeat us, and they'll try all kinds of tricks to get us to give in. Free drinks, travel permits... Why not just give in?

But it's a bluff, covid will pass, if only because we will develop natural herd immunity.

And the vaccine will fail once the side effects become obvious, at which point the public will lose all trust. We know this because that always happens with experimental vaccines with zero liability, it's in their interest to make people sick with them. At least they have no reason to make them safe, except maybe the Cuban one, but that's not even considered.

So we just need to be patient and not give in, it's just a matter of time before this blows up in their faces. When have the governments not messed something like this up?",-1
"Bots spreading propaganda on Twitter. Armoured police officers clubbing peaceful protesters. Unprecedented censorship. Vaccine passports for a cold virus with a 99.9% survival rate. Insurmountable hospital backlogs. A crippled economy. Widespread depression. Divided families. Was it all worth it?
This is what happens when you give away your freedoms and rights to governments for ""safety"". Maybe if you stopped to think logically for a moment about what's going on around you we wouldn't be in this fucking mess right now. If you apply logic to ANY of this it all falls apart. For example, why's it okay for you to not wear a mask when you're sitting down in a restaurant but you MUST wear one when you're standing up? I'm sorry I can't just shut my brain off and pretend there's a super scary virus that you can spread asymptomatically.

The only reason this has managed to go on as long as it has is because of our advanced technology and our over-reliance on it. It has allowed frightened idiots to spew their every waking thought on social media and spread their NPC energy to others. Those same idiots have relied on streaming and delivery services to see them through the ""pandemic"". I can't imagine they'd stay inside as long as they have without Netflix or GrubHub. They like their gilded cage; it's cozy, comfortable and cushy. 

With the furlough scheme ending in the UK and widespread food shortages I'm hoping to see a bit more resistance if there's another lockdown or a tightening of restrictions. We cannot allow fear to rule our lives forever. Life is not lived without risks and the risk of Covid is very, very low. If you've been ""jabbed"" you should be unafraid and unmasked. If you're that worried about someone else's vaccination status it just proves you have zero confidence in your own ""vaccine"". Stop getting tested and delete the fucking app. STOP complying with these tyrants. They have brought us nothing but fucking misery and division since the start of all this. Lockdowns are not the answer, never have been.",-1
"3 Rules/laws that could help us move on past COVID-19
In recent weeks the governmentâ€™s failings in combatting COVID-19 has been increasingly evident. As such I came up with 3 simple rules/laws which the Government could easily enforce (if they wished to), which would reduce deaths, reduce hospital workload and reduce fear.

1. Make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory: 

Singapore is known internationally for imposing strict laws to maintain order, quite often with minimal positive impact to the general population. Therefore it is shocking to me that we have not made COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory, this would reduce deaths, reduce hospital workload and allow us to return to normal faster. So few unvaccinated people remain, yet they make up the vast majority of cases in our hospital and ICU beds. If there was ever a time to be draconian in imposing laws, it is now. Vaccines save lives, it is evident from the data both locally and globally, the alternative is to continue to be hostages to worst members of our society. If these people refuse, well then the fines can begin, if that is not enough, we should escalate further. *Note: those unable to be vaccinated due to health/medical reasons would obviously be exempt from this, but measures should be put in place to ensure anti-vaxxers donâ€™t try to utilise this avenue to escape vaccination.*

2. Turn non-urgent cases away from hospitals (and even GPs):

We have been spoilt by our healthcare services over the years, to the point where going to the GP or even A&amp;E for the mildest reason is the norm. Most other countries do not have this attitude, if you turn up to A&amp;E without valid reason for being there you are turned away. While I realise this goes against much of how our healthcare system has operated in the past, if we are not more selective in who comes into hospitals they will begin implode. Many healthcare workers have already noted that too many mild cases are turning up to hospital, expecting to be treated. These people should be turned away and in egregious cases given a clear warning regarding their behaviour. This simple action will help further reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

3. Stop regular testing:

Fear has been the key driver in the above issue. Over the past year the government has used fear of COVID-19 as a mechanism to ensure compliance to any rules that have been implemented. The reality is that those whose who are vaccinated have a lower risk of death when compared to the flu. If we donâ€™t change how we perceive COVID-19 in a post vaccine world we will continue to be trapped by it. Reducing regular testing will help take away the spectre of fear that is currently over us all. Some might say that allowing the continued spread of COVID-19 unchecked may lead to new variants, this is true. However, to combat this fully would require a COVID zero approach globally, which will never happen, meaning there is little we can do to stop any evolution (though it should be stated that most viruses evolve over time to be more infectious and less deadly, as a dead host means a dead virus). At least if we stop regular testing the fear enshrined in our minds will slowly begin to dissolve.

Please do let me know if you have any comments or you think there are some flaws (major or minor) in these ideas. I just hope this starts a discussion which hopefully pushes us in a safer direction. Because as long as our healthcare workers are overwhelmed and anti-vaxxers are still present, none of us are truly safe, either from COVID-19 or other medical ailments that we are not able to get proper attention for. Stay safe.",1

"The FDA is suppressing possible COVID-19 treatments in order for the vaccines to maintain Emergency Use Authorization.
The vaccine is an ineffective preventative, plain and simple. That means there will be breakthrough cases and people needing treatment. If you go into a hospital with covid today, they will lay you down and watch you die, may or may not give you a ventilator (which are sketchy anyway depending on which studies you read). In order for some of the vaccines to maintain emergency use authorization in areas where it hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t been ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœFDA approvedÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, there cannot be any viable alternative treatments. This is why big pharma and the FDA are feverishly shutting down *any* potential treatment. 

These treatments include NAC, a supplement that has been used in hospitals for pneumonia patients (among other things) that has been available OTC for decades. NAC is now being threatened off shelves and online retailers, and the FDA is in the process of classifying it a ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœdrugÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and not making it available for OTC purchase. Ivermectin is being tossed out at ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœhorse dewormerÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â instead of proper research. Monoclonal Antibodies were once touted as another conspiracy theory by the left, and is now being rationed out due to high demand. 

The FDA, big pharma, and the government do not want you to know about any potential treatments, and to believe that this respiratory virus can *ONLY* be prevented with a vaccine that has horrible (by vaccine standards) efficacy rates.",-1
"THE COVID 19 VACCINE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST EXPOSED
If you donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t take the vaccine you  will be killed, and if you take it youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll regret it forever. This is the  most valuable piece of information on the entire earth at this time.  You need to share this message with everyone. The Harvest is plenty but  the workers are few Luke 10:2. THE FINAL WAR HAS BEGUN.

THE  COVID-19 VACCINE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST spoken of in The Bible!  technology 666. Covid-19 is a global plan. Part of that plan is the  collapse of the global economy. The Beast spoken about in the Bible is a  system, a satanic organization. These people are called ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœ33rd degree  freemasonsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and they control the entire world, all of the religions, the  media, news, music, movies, and the mainstream narrative. Freemasonry  is an ancient cult of rich white people. The god of freemasonry is  literally Satan from the Bible. The richest people in the world  literally worship Satan. They want to create a new world order, a world  society, each person marked and controllable.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

The  vaccine contains a gene editing technology called Cryspr, to change  your DNA. You will never be the same after taking it. It also contains  nanotechnology to connect humans to the Internet and control them. This  is called ""Neural Link"" mind control, using A.I. (artificial  intelligence) supercomputer technology. It will give them ultimate power  over people. To kill them or to control them. This is why they are  installing 5G towers around the world at a rapid rate. 5G speed is  needed to successfully control millions of people. They will turn them  on when more people are vaccinated. BIBLICAL PROPHECY.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

The  vaccine also contains a chemical called luciferase which is taken from  fireflies to make you scannable, so they can see who has taken the mark  of the beast vaccine. They are creating the race of Lucifer. It even has  Lucifer's name in it! Anyone who takes this vaccine will go to hell on  judgment day according to the Bible. They even called this thing  Microsoft Patent # 666!

\-&gt; **Revelation 13:16-18.**  (16) And they cause that all, young and old, rich and poor, free and  prisoner, receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead (17)  And that no person could buy or sell, unless he received the mark, or  the name of the beast, or the number of his name \[all of these mean  taking the vaccine!\]. And that eventually all should be killed who  refuse. (18) Here iswisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the  number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s number is  Six hundred sixty six.

\- The book  of Revelation was created from a dream that John received from ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤Ã‚Â„ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤Ã‚Â‰ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤Ã‚Â„ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤Ã‚Â€  (Ahayah = I AM) The Most High God. The details of visions and dreams  have metaphorical interpretations.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

\* Forehead = thoughts.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

\* Name = authority / purpose.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

\* The number of a man = mankind's patent system.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

\* ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s number is 666 = Microsoft Patent # 666.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

The  greek word for what was translated as ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœmarkÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â is khar'-ag-mah, and it  means a scratch or etching, something that pierces the skin! A VACCINE.  The mark is literal. The location of the mark is not literal. Right hand  = being able to work and earn and spend money.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

The  vaccine will soon be mandatory. You will have to take the vaccine in  order to join the new system they are creating. That is why Microsoft  and other software companies are involved in this vaccine. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not a  vaccine. Bill Gates is not a doctor and Microsoft is not a medicine  company, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a software company! This vaccine contains software to  introduce a Global ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœBiometrics-enabled Digital Cryptocurrency SystemÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â.  This is a new system of money that will soon be released after they get  rid of cash money. They will blame money for spreading Covid-19. WATCH!

\-&gt; **Revelation 14:9-11.**  (9) If anyone worships the beast (freemasons/illuminati) and his image,  and receives his mark in his hand or in his forehead,(10) he will drink  of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without admixture  into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and  brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of  Christ: (11) And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever;  and they have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and his  image, and who receive the mark of itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s name.

\-&gt; Worship = submit to \[receive the technology in their vaccine\].ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

\* Image = Supercomputer Artificial Intelligence system.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

\*  Name = authority / purpose. Satan's purpose is to get people to be sent  to hell on the day of judgment. Instead of influencing you to live a  life of sin, they now have a new way to get people to be damned to hell  forever by God. All they have to do now is get you to take the mark.  They want everyone to take the vaccine.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

Google  study / research these keywords: Neural Link, Luciferase,  Thermagrippers, Cryspr, Hydrogel, Quantum Dots, Artificial Intelligence  5G exposed, Microsoft patent # 666, Freemasonry exposed, Illuminati  exposed, AGENDA 21 EXPOSED, Georgia Guidestones New World Order, etc.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

Conclusion:  they want to connect us to the A.I. supercomputer so they can control  us, and they want to change our DNA! This is why people do not repent  during the plagues that God will send on the earth soon. It tells you  that in Revelation 9:20. (20) And the rest of mankind who were not  killed by these plagues still did not repent of their sins. -&gt; They  are under mind control. Most peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s thoughts are already controlled by  demons, this technology will make it permanent. They will eventually  get the marked people to hunt down and kill the unmarked people when  they activate the Neural Link between the supercomputer and the marked  people through 5G.

Revelation  13:15 = They had power to give life to the image of the beast so that it  can use the marked people to kill everyone who doesn't submit and take  the mark of the beast = Connecting people to the system. Control of  thoughts. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s also how they get all of these marked people to fight  Christ when he returns. Revelation 17:14, Joel 3, and Revelation  19:19-21 tells you about that.

Revelation  19:19 = And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their  armies, gathered together to make war against Christ. Revelation 19:20  tells you that people will be deceived into taking the mark of the  beast. Revelation 19:20: And the beast\[the secret societies that control  the world\] was taken away, and with him the false prophet\[the churches  that are telling people to take the vaccine\] who deceived them that had  received the mark of the beast, were thrown into the lake of fire, hell.  -&gt; people took the vaccine because they did not know it was the mark  of the beast.

Revelation 19:21. =  And the rest of humanity who did not keep GodÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s laws or had the mark of  the beast were killed by Christ, and all the birds of the air were  filled with their flesh. Matthew 24:37 = But as the days of Noah were,  so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Matthew 24:22 = And  except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.  -&gt; If you do some research you will find that there were a lot of  scientific experiments going on by the fallen angels before the flood,  in Noah's day! Genetic modification. -&gt; If you look up the hebrew  words which were translated, the word for flesh = human genetic code.  saved = preserved! What Matthew 24:22 really says is ""except those days  should be shortened, all genetic codes will be tampered with.""

\-&gt;  The children of the fallen angels are the ones in power, and they want  to give us their genetic code. Once you inject this stuff into you, you  will never be the same again. Whoever takes the mark of the beast will  be sent to hell on the day of judgement when God judges us. Here is what  the Bible says about people who put their trust in the satanic  weaponized vaccine that satanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s people have created instead of God.

**\[Romans 6:16\]**  Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves as servants to obey,  his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of  obedience unto righteousness?

**\[1 Corinthians 3:16\]** Know you not that you are the Temple of God, and that The Spirit of God dwelleth in you?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

**\[Mark 12:17\]** And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.

**\[1 Corinthians 6:19-20\]**  Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is  in you, whom you have received from God? Therefore honor God with your  bodies.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

**\[1 Timothy 6:20\]**  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane  and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

**\[1 Corinthians 3:17\]** If any man defiles the Temple of God, God will destroy him.

\-  In Genesis, God said that the plants he made were for the healing of  the nations. Is that true or not? Who will you serve? The Satanic  elites, in their news articles and websites on the Internet, are calling  the Covid-19 vaccine ""THE MESSIAH"", and ""OUR ONLY HOPE"". They like to  make fun of Christ and they like to make fun of people. They know that  whoever takes this vaccine will be damned forever. They are celebrating  this great sacrifice of souls to Satan their God.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

Did  you know that all vaccines contain aborted fetus cells? ABOMINATION.  This Covid-19 vaccine is unlike any other vaccine ever created. This is  actually a software update for humans. As if we were computers. Don't  believe the people on TV, they have an agenda! They are paid readers,  reading from a script! A lot of people have actually DIED from taking  the vaccine! They are trying to hide this fact from us.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â 

Freemasons  own the news stations all over the world. They control the dominant  narrative. The groups that have controlled the world for hundreds of  years and thousands of years are: ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe IlluminatiÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. The Rosicrucians.  The Knights Templar. The Skull and Bones Society. Jesuits. Freemasonry.  Zionists. The Order Of The Dragon. These extremely powerful  organizations control the whole world, working for the devil! How do  they do it? They have inserted people into key positions in every  government, organization, corporation, and church.

Conclusion:  The COVID-19 vaccine is the mark of the beast . Do not take it under  any circumstance! You will have to fight with your life to prevent  getting it. These are the final moments of the earth. Wake up others to  this truth if you want a chance to make it in to heaven. Go and sin no  more.

"Did the covid affect your period?
Ok first off, I'm a big believer in science and I think the vaccine is our best way out of this pandemic. I am excited to be vaccinated as It has been very much proven to be safe and effective.

But this is the modern world and female symptoms often go unreported and under studied. 

So after getting freaked out about a very late period, I posted here and received a response about it possibly being caused by an immune response to the vaccine. [Currently 10 days late, negative pregnancy tests and received my first dose of Pfizer right as my period was due]

Figured I'd ask a wider audience to see if anyone noticed this? If nothing else, the power of Reddit, I'd light to highlight these side effects to the researchers currently studying the vaccine.

Edit: 
Glad I'm not alone and found out what caused my issue. For anyone who finds this post, my period arrived today, 11 days late. 

From what I can tell, the effects differ depending on birth control and when in your cycle you get the shot. I got my shot the day it was due and some forums on Pre-mom reported the vaccine made their LH surge. (They're all tracking it for ovulation to try and conceive) so there will be data in the coming months on the causes but largely proven to be safe and doesn't cause any long term damage to fertility! Phew!",1
"Sore arm after covid vaccine that didn't go away
Hello everyone,

I'm a 27M with no existing health issues/no medications. I got my Pfizer vaccine a week ago, the nurse injected the shot into my left arm (around the biceps if I remember correctly, not deltoid). When I make a motion like biceps curl, my left biceps feels like I had a rough workout that didn't heal.

After doing that motion for a while, the irritation goes away for a while, only to come back. I do remember that this sensation was worse and has gotten a little better, but it scared me that experts keep saying arm soreness should go away after 2 days. My anxiety has been bothering me, what do you guys think? Thank you so much!",0
"Terrified to get second Covid Vaccine
I just got my first shot this month and I am super scared to get my second one next month. I am surrounded by anti vaxxers when it comes to my family and even some of my friends. I am one of three people in both mine and my husbandÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s family that is getting vaccinated. 

Of course they are completely against it. Even my husband makes jokes about me shortening my life span. Along with that I keep seeing things about people having terrible, long lasting reactions to the second vaccine in another subreddit. 

Now every time I think about getting my second shot I panic. Just to get comfortable enough to get the first shot I had to talk with my therapist and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m sure she will say the same things if I contact her again about the second shot. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m afraid that what she has to say is not going to help this time. 

I want to be fully vaccinated, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m so scared IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m afraid I might end up not getting it. 

Any advice on this would be really appreciated.",0
"All members of AB6IX are now vaccinated against Covid with at least their first dose
The SIGH of relief man. Donghyun was the last member to finally get his first dose today. His arm is going to be on fire tomorrow for his drama filming and Inkigayo performance but - worth it!

Daehwi and Woong (and their manager) have already talked about getting their 2nd doses together (last week?) because Woong likes to cry about the pain on Universe. Woojin mentioned getting his 1st dose back in Sept so he should also have had his 2nd dose by now. And now Donghyun has received his 1st dose. 

This is small shit but wooohooooðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰ I go into covid patient rooms and the delta variant has been a beast to even seemingly healthy adults. It amazes me Korea was so behind on vaccinations. With hearing about how so many kpop groups have had covid infections/scares/close contact quarantines over the past months, and taking into consideration that AB6IXâ€™s managers are obese and are at higher risk for complications of dying from covid (not saying that to be rude but from a medical perspective) I am really happy to hear they are vaccinated. And SUPER happy no one in their group ever reported infection scares, despite all their busy schedules and working around large groups (since they usually have a dance team on stage with them).

They could still get infected by covid, but itâ€™s so nice to know they wonâ€™t die from it, or their recovery time will be much quicker and risk of damage to their lungs/development of respiratory symptoms will also be greatly reduced. 

Good job BNM staff and BNM managers for helping keep people masked up as much as possible during the past year of quarantine restrictions. ðŸ‘ They also got lucky but props to them for also protecting their staff, and I always see the managers masked up at least. I am still a little amazed AB6IX never had a covid scare because they do some risky things (like taking masks off in the music show waiting rooms, being maskless behind stage before performing). 

Anyway, when it comes to covid, the best good news is no news at all :) So good job AB6IX &amp; BNM for staying covid-free all the way up to vaccination! ðŸ…",1
"Prolonged fatigue after Covid vaccination
I got my second shot of the Moderna vaccine around the middle of May and I can confidently say I've had maybe 1-2 days since then where I've actually felt even remotely close to good on the bike. I've had atleast 3 rest weeks and when I get back on the bike afterwards I still feel completely boxed. 

I managed to squeeze through several road races and ToAD feeling acceptable but nowhere near how I should feel given my normal level in training. I just finished BWR today with a super easy week leading up to it and I barely survived. 

Anyone else have similar experiences? I know everyone has a different kind of reaction. Some of my friends were completely demolished for atleast a day afterwards but have felt fine since. 

let me just say I'm glad I got the vaccine. Whether this is related to the vaccine or not it's still better than covid.",0
"Virtually all hospitalized Covid patients have one thing in common: They're unvaccinated
#Virtually all hospitalized Covid patients have one thing in common: They're unvaccinated

**""I haven't had anyone that's been fully vaccinated become critically ill,"" one doctor said.**


*June 11, 2021, 2:39 PM PDT*

*By Erika Edwards*

There are only three Covid-19 patients at Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital at North Shore University Hospital, on Long Island, New York ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” a far cry from when the hospital, which is part of Northwell Health, had as many as 600 patients during the peak of the pandemic.

All three patients, who are in the intensive care unit, have one thing in common, said Dr. Hugh Cassiere, director of the hospital's critical care services: They're unvaccinated.

The trend appears to be occurring at hospitals nationwide.

""I haven't had anyone that's been fully vaccinated become critically ill,"" said Dr. Josh Denson, a pulmonary medicine and critical care physician at Tulane University Medical Center in New Orleans.

It's been the same for Dr. Ken Lyn-Kew, a pulmonologist in the critical care department at Denver's National Jewish Health: ""None of our ICU patients has been vaccinated.""

Unvaccinated children, too, seem to be at increased risk for severe illness.

""In our local hospitals, the kids that are getting sick are the ones that are not vaccinated,"" said Dr. Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Overland Park, Kansas, and a national spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Thanks to the Covid-19 vaccines, the number of patients hospitalized has plummeted, from more than 125,000 on average in early January to just over 15,000 on average this week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The vaccines are working really well,"" Denson said. ""It's just ridiculous not to get it.""

Just over half of adults ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” 53 percent ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” have been fully vaccinated.

Critical care doctors have also emphasized the importance of completing the Covid-19 vaccination series.

Dr. Todd Rice, director the medical intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the hospital has admitted at least 32 patients who were only partially vaccinated, meaning they'd received one shot or hadn't had enough time after their final dose for their immune systems to develop protective antibodies.

But the overwhelming majority of sick patients in recent months ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” since the vaccines have become widely available ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” have not been vaccinated, Rice said.

Breakthrough infections ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” meaning ones that occur in fully vaccinated individuals ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” are possible, though extremely rare. If they do occur, it's highly unlikely that a person will need to be hospitalized, according a study posted Friday to the preprint server MedRxiv. (Studies posted to preprint severs have not been peer-reviewed.)

When Rice has seen breakthrough cases needing hospitalization, it was only in patients with compromised immune systems, who therefore likely did not respond as well to the vaccines.

""One of the ones we took care of had cancer, and another was on immunosuppressants for a rheumatologic disease,"" Rice said.

Lyn-Kew, too, had one or two extremely ill patients who'd been fully vaccinated.

""It turns out they were all immunosuppressed,"" he said.

Some, he said, had cancer at the time of their shots and did not respond well to the vaccines.

Though the CDC recommends people get vaccinated regardless of whether they were previously infected, Lyn-Kew said some of his hospitalized patients had decided to forgo vaccination because of previous illness ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” even if they'd never been tested to confirm they had Covid-19.

""They thought they were sick from Covid, but they weren't. And they have the mindset of, 'Oh, I don't need to get vaccinated because of that,'"" Lyn-Kew said. ""They're gravely mistaken.""

Hello all, I saw someone on Twitter say that they're scared of being a ""breakthrough case"" even though they're fully vaccinated and in particular, what was scaring them was the fact that they could experience the symptom of loss of smell/taste. I'm from Australia and sadly, our vaccine rollout has been a mess so a lot of us are only just vaccinated, so we're pretty new to this. And I'm a bit worried myself.

"Covid and vaccine belief differences
My nanny family are anti-vax, at least when it comes to covid. I try my best not to talk anything political with them so I don’t know what all they believe but I know they fall into some conspiracy beliefs based on Facebook posts and whatnot. It hasn’t been a problem, so far they’ve been respectful of me and my choices and they’re careful regarding covid- don’t over socialize, wear masks as far as I know, etc. again, I don’t ask too many questions. But I don’t feel they’re putting me in danger. The mom asked if I’m vaccinated quite a few months ago but didn’t comment on the fact that I am beyond normal “did you have any bad side effects?” Type of stuff. However, it seems her beliefs are escalating based on her Facebook posts and today she texted and asked if I’m planning on getting a third dose. First of all, I kind of feel like she’s breaching privacy expectations. She was so blunt about it and didn’t give any explanation, it made me super uncomfortable, but I answered honestly that I probably will once I’m eligible. She hasn’t messaged back but I’m super anxious and debating how I’m gonna handle it if she gives me crap. I like this job and this family in general but honestly I’m getting a bit burnt out with them. They’re super nice and we’ve gotten along super well so far but they don’t let me leave the house with the kids at all or do much of anything, which sucks, some of our discipline beliefs don’t align, and I feel like I have better opportunities. Plus, they underpay me. I chose my own rate but it’s been a year and I feel like it’s not enough anymore but I’m afraid to ask for a raise. I’m currently getting 15/hour for two kids, ages 3 and 2. It’s 3 3 hour days a week. I just turned 18 which is why I’ve been charging that, but I live in an area with much higher wages. I just feel like it’s not worth staying if I’m going to have to feel uncomfortable or deal with any crap about vaccines or covid or anything. I feel like it’s not gonna take a lot to make me put in my two weeks and find something else, and I know I wouldn’t have a hard time finding something else. 

Idk. I’m just stressed and needed to get it off my chest. If you guys have any thoughts or advice about how to handle this or similar situations or anything please feel free to share!",-1
"How does the covid vaccine help someone with a strong immune system?
Excuse my ignorance. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s so much conflicting information out there as weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re all learning about covid together. 

I understand that the vaccines will help reduce the severity of covid symptoms and therefore lessen the burden of healthcare workers, save lives, reduce the number of inpatients. I myself completed the 2 rounds of Pfizer and do my part in masking up and avoiding crowds. What I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t understand is how necessary the vaccine is for people with strong immune systems. 

Vaccinated individuals may still get covid and spread the virus. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s say they spread it to someone who is unvaccinated but has a strong immune system. Then that person becomes an asymptomatic carrier. How is this person different from a vaccinated one? Are they not both carriers who can spread the virus to vulnerable people? Adults can get vaccinated to minimize their risk but what about children? While being vaccinated lowers your risk of dying from covid if infected, does it change the probability of spreading it to others?

I ask this because IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m genuinely curious. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not trying to be divisive or start an argument.",1
"The biggest Conspiracy about Covid 19 is that...
Everyone needs to be vaccinated.

I see all these posters claiming the unvaccinated are all conspiracy theorists. In reality its the people that are pushing the vaccine that are the conspiracy theorists. The unvaxxed don't care what the vaxxed do, likewise the vaxxed shouldn't care about what the unvaxxed do. Herd immunity is through natural immunity OR vaccination, that's a fact. Let people make their choice, the risks in any case are yours to hold and yours alone. The vaccinated who are pressing the vaccine are the most delusional of the bunch IMHO. 

What is next? The government making micro chips embedded into every human being mandatory? good job vax pushers

Edit 1: Vaxxers blame the unvaxxed for the mutations. All mutations will be blamed on the unvaxxed. In what world did anyone think it would be possible to vaxx 100% of the population at the same time in order to isolate and prevent mutations. MUTATIONS are inevitable! There is no way possible to prevent this even if you successfully obtained 90-100% vaccinations. IMPOSSIBLE",1

"COVID Vaccine caused a flare up
I'm very frustrated right now. My sarcoidosis has been in remission for almost a year. I haven't had any granuloma formation and I'm able to control my systemic inflammation through a strict diet and exercise routine. I've been feeling really healthy and proud of myself.

A week ago I was lucky enough to qualify for the pfizer COVID vaccine, so of course I jumped on it. My arm was sore for a few days, which was manageable with some ice and ibuprofen. I felt kind ill for a day or two, but still manageable.

Few days ago I started getting joint pain and I've been exhausted. I thought maybe I've been over-training and just pushed through. Today I woke up with sarcoidosis patches on my neck. That's always my first sign of high inflammation. FML.

I don't know what to do and I'm really upset. When my inflammation raises, it's always due to a poor diet or indulgent decision, so I just correct it with strict AIP diet or a fruit and veggie fast. This time, I did everything right. I've actually been feeling like I'm in control of this disease, and now I'm being reminded that I'm not.

Don't get me wrong, I am thrilled that I got the vaccine. I will absolutely be getting my second dose as well. I'll take a flare up any day over the risks that come with COVID. I just wish I could have a normal reaction like everyone else. I hate that this disease has so much control over my life.

Update: Not everyone is going to have an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I pulled the short straw, but will absolutely be getting my second vaccine regardless of the flare up. Covid is scary, unpredictable, and potentially fatal. Flare ups suck, but I have some great doctors to help me.",1

Note, She received Pfizer and I received Moderna, so a little bit of an experiment right now in our apartment. 

In addition to being vaccinated we both also take 12,000 IUs Vit. D, quercetin, bromelain, zinc. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re in average shape (not obese, but not particularly active during the pandemic). 

Will update later this week. Hopefully the vaccine keeps things relatively mild.


Edit: we also have both had metallic tastes in our mouth come and go, but can still smell and taste alright.

Second edit: GF and I tested negative per a test that was performed on Sunday the 14th. Original positive tests were performed on Friday the 12th, reported Monday the 15th.  Symptoms are the same: pretty tired with a minor cough. Tests were all PCR.

Third Edit: GF has now tested negative twice. I seem to be fine beside some fatigue and needing to clear my throat once in a while.

"/u/AlanMppn on What is your opinion on the covid 19 vaccine?
I think the vaccines are very safe. There are of course possible side effects, some life-threatening, but the odds are still incredibly low and you are much better off getting the vaccine. Globally the world has administered over 600million vaccines, and really there have only been a handful of problems. The recent issue that made headlines in pausing J&amp;J vaccine because 6 people out of 6+ million got blood clots to me was ridiculous. Literally less than a one in a million chance of this happening. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m glad theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve resumed but it never should have stopped with those kinds of numbers. I have not gotten a vaccine and donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t really plan to since I had Covid, and basic immunology tells us vaccinating yourself against an infection youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve had is unnecessary and so far thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s no data to contradict this. Of course the virus could evolve, in which case my natural immunity would be just as useless as the immunity I would get from the vaccine. Anyone who has not had Covid I think should feel safe to get vaccinated. If you do come across any story claiming a death or a dangerous side effect, look for the actual number of report cases vs vaccinations. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s all that matters, is what is the likelihood of occurrence, which typically is so infrequent it might as well be zero.

"COVID VAC SIRVA, need help in pain.
I had a pretty severe case of COVID Oct. 2020. Was down for 6 weeks, it was horrible and I never want to go through it again. 

I got my first Pfizer Vac early May and had the normal side effects. Sore muscle at my injection site, low grade fever, full body joint pains and chills. Lasted about 48 hrs and I was fine. 

Today, I got my 2nd dose at the same hospital. As soon as the nurse injected I felt burning and pain in my shoulder, where I never felt anything during my first dose during injection. 

The nurse said ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœoh waitÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â when she went to put the band-aide on...but I thought nothing of it because after the initial pain of the injection, my arm felt fine. I waited the 15 minutes and left. 

Then I get home and see the band-aide literally on my shoulder, above any muscle. An hour later my shoulder joint was IN SO MUCH PAIN! It has gotten worse and at this point I can not lift my vaccinated arm without severe pain in my shoulder. Pain is in my shoulder JOINT, not muscle pain which I felt after my first dose and other IM vaccines. I can not lift my arm at all, it is literally almost stuck. 

What the hell am I supposed to do? Anyone else have this happen? Will this dose even get absorbed normally when it was not given the right way? Will I be able to move my arm anytime soon?",0
"Doesn't this mean we could be effed?
&gt;...these less-than-perfect vaccines create a “leaky” barrier against the virus. Vaccinated individuals may get sick but have less severe symptoms, but the virus survives long enough to transmit to others, which allows it to survive and spread throughout a population.

&gt;“Our research demonstrates that the use of **leaky vaccines can promote the evolution of nastier ‘hot’ viral strains** that put unvaccinated individuals at greater risk,” Nair said.

&gt;Marek’s disease used to be a minor ailment that did little harm to chickens in the 1950s, but the virus has grown stronger and today is **capable of killing all the unvaccinated birds in poultry flocks, sometimes within 10 days.**

"Pfizer COVID vaccination (8 weeks apart - UK)
Hi, so I thought I'd post my experience of getting the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination here in the UK as a lot of the posts in this group are from people in countries such as the USA where the population are having the vaccine doses 21-28 days apart, as per the manufacturers guidance. 

Here in the UK our vaccination regulatory board, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JVCI), ruled that everybody will be having their two-dose COVID vaccinations between 8 and 12 weeks apart, regardless of which type of COVID vaccine they are given (Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca, etc)

I'd like to post as much information about my situation as possible in hopes that it may provide some insight into how you may feel after your vaccine. Firstly, I'm 26F and was diagnosed with SLE in July 2017. I am currently on 5 mg prednisolone, 200 mg hydroxychloroquine, vitamin D3 and calcium tablets, 35 mg lanzoprazole and 125 mg azathioprine daily. My lupus isn't fully under control, I still have mild symptoms of arthritis on a daily basis which is bad first thing in a morning but get better throughout the day. I have no lupus nephritis or other complications (that I know of!). 

Due to being on both steroids and immunosuppressants, I have been placed in the clinically extremely vulnerable patient group and therefore was illegible for the first dose of the vaccine quite early during the roll out. I was invited for my first shot on 30th December 2020 and had a yellow bruise that lasted for about 10 days. I also suffered fatigue and a headache for a couple of days after the first shot but was generally well. Between the first and second doses (mine were 8 weeks apart), my lupus has still been causing me trouble in terms of arthritis as usual, and I've had unrelated issues with my posture causing me to have regular back pain and headaches. 

I had my second dose last Wednesday (24th February 2021) and again have developed a small yellow bruise where the jab was administered. On the day of the vaccine I developed a headache in the afternoon (had the jab at 11am, headache started around 4pm) which lasted around 24 hours, but otherwise I have had no other adverse side effects and am feeling generally well 5 days later. 

Please feel free to ask any questions about the experience of having the vaccination, my experience living with lupus/symptoms etc, or any other questions and I'll try my best to answer as honestly as I can ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â˜Ã‚ÂºÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¸Ã‚Â",1

Dr. Carrie Madej joined ""The Stew Peters Show"" with images that should shock the entire world, and should immediately be investigated by  lawmakers. She says a million nanoparticles can exist in each needle of the covid vaccine syringe. So millions of robotic nanites can enter your blood stream and most importantly the children. This is not informed consent. This is a Cyborg take over in my opinion. She tells Stew the nanobots can construct themselves and build infrastructure that you can be seen in real time inside your blood. She says these are parasitic agents being injected into people without their consent. She says the nano particles look a lot like Hydra vulgaris, which are fresh-water polyp, its a small animal freshwater hydroid with length from 10 mm to 30 mm and width about 1 mm which transhumanist love to study because its immortal and continues to produce it's own stem cells.  So the nanobots in the covid vaccine vial operate this way but are metallic and robotic and can be programmed, possibly programmed to do more to your body and even your mind at the behest of someone else's interests.

"A tyrannical, totalitarian government is just as deadly and hard to get rid of as any disease.
I had a conversation with a friend of mine. He and I usually agree on things, but he is very pro-vax and pro-mandates. We were talking about why I'm unvaxxed, and I think you guys would like my viewpoint:

Whether or not the vaccine is safe, I know it's wrong to ""mandate"" people's healthcare, their speech, what they can do on a day-to-day basis, and so on. Nevermind that Covid is not nearly as dangerous as some people think. Even if Covid was super crazy deadly, I don't support the government overstepping it's bounds and meddling with people's lives.

I served a church mission in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. During the 2 years I was there, I saw how people's freedoms, mental and spiritual health, and general standard of living had suffered under communism. Thankfully, they threw off the oppressive rule years ago, but I met thousands and thousands of people who were still wearing the scars of that time. Some people are still missing loved ones they lost to the oppressive regime.

I dont want anything like that in any country. And governments across the world are trying to grab power, using the fear of disease to control people. Hence my viewpoint: we should be just as wary of oppressive government as we should disease. Both can kill you, both are far-reaching...

But one of them is sentient and cunning, and can actively control its own spread.",-1

"My parents are vaccine skeptics who had COVID and wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get vaccinated. What else can I do?
I am in despair. A coworker was with a family member all week, one who was in the ICU and they died this morning.

My parents are vaccine deniers who listen to a certain political viewpoint and heavily one sided news stories that decry all sorts of garbage about how the vaccine hurts people and ruins lives. My mom reportedly went to her orthopedic doctor the other day who told her that he ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœheard of someone who got the vaccine and was previously able to speak German but couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t afterwards.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â Wat.

Both of them had COVID already and recovered, and they said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœit wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t any worse than the fluÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. But the evidence suggests that getting it and recovering isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t as effective as a vaccine nor will the future boosters we may need be invalidate by their recovery...

They are in their mid 60ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s and smart enough people (the irony is overwhelmingly heart wrenching), but they have been misled for years listening to heavily biased sources that tell all kinds of tales of woe and misbegotten calamity for people who donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t share their viewpoint.

They are Christians and I consider myself to be a Christ follower, but I feel like they are so self possessed in ideas of puerile anti-scientific skepticism and unreasoned thought that I canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t reconcile myself to who these people are. DoesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t it matter to them that if they die they will be leaving behind people who will be both sad and outraged at their folly? CanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t they see it would be the same if I died??

WeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve argued about it on the phone a few weeks ago and I tried to be understanding, but no progress was made. They just kept trying to make me change my mind and wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t listen.

Anyway...hereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s what I sent them by text today:

Hello dear parents, a coworker of mine has spent the last week with a family member who was in the ICU. The family member died of Covid this morning.

Please put aside your reticence, the voices of the skeptics and do what love requires--to take care of yourselves because you want to be around for us. Could you imagine how you would feel if your parents died from covid or if Hannah or I did? You would say: ""why didn't they listen and do the simple thing?""  Love requires we give up a little of what we want for the benefit of others. Your existence matters and is a gift to us. Do not let that be taken away because the unwise pander half truths and ignore plain fact.

Put aside the foolishness of the media and naysayers who are in the tiniest minority and get vaccinated. There's evidence that we will all need to get boosters once a year. Decide today to do what's right and continue in that path.

I want you both in my life for years to come. Please heed the voice of wisdom.",1
"My PMS Symptoms have been extremely bad since receiving my COVID vaccine &amp; I feel alone
Hi everyone, 

I'm posting this because I feel like people aren't talking about this enough, and honestly I am a little scared. I received my 1st dose in June and my 2nd just over 2 weeks ago. Every cycle since I received my shot has been so awful and intense that I've ended up in the ER every month. 

I have an IUD (Mirena) so I don't get my period anymore, but can usually loosely track my cycle through mood and discharge. I have been having such intense PMS symptoms (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, panic attacks, headaches, aches) that I feel like something changed. I'm currently writing this after vomiting and with a migraine because I just want someone to be able to relate. I know that it's cycle related because it happens on the last day of every month, following into the beginning of the next.  

Has anyone experienced the PMS symptoms along with the heavy bleeding being reported?  I fully believe in vaccines &amp; science, but these severe changes have me concerned. I don't want to be having severe panic attacks and puking every cycle like before I got my IUD. Is there research being done on this?",0
"CMV:Getting the covid-19 vaccine shouldn't be a choice, it should be mandatory. Refusing to get it when you are eligible should be criminal.
The only people who should be excluded from that are those who are not eligible due to a legitimate medical reason, such as an allergy or an immuno-compromised system. 

This isn't about freedom. Your freedom ends where it infringes on others people's freedom. And this is literally what you are doing by walking around unvaccinated. You are not just infringing on others' freedom, you are also putting their health and lives in danger. 

Refusing to get the vaccine if you are eligible is a crime and some people could die due to your inaction. In my country, they are jailing people who spread ""anti-vax propaganda"" on social media, and rightly so. People who refuse to get the vaccine if they are eligible are also facing increasingly harsher restrictions, rightly so as well.

"/u/LateralThinker13 on According to a new poll 45% of Republicans say they will not get a covid vaccine. Why do you think that is?
1) I won't take ANYTHING that requires a waiver to indemnify the manufacturer against any and all side effects.

2) It doesn't prevent me from getting covid. Just supposedly reduces the chances.

3) I'm under 50 without comorbidities. I have a chance of dying from covid that's virtually zero.

4) I don't live by the precautionary principle. I am not a scared sheep dancing to anybody's bidding because ""better safe than sorry.""

EDIT: So in summary, I can't sue if the uncertified and untested vaccine harms/kills me, it doesn't actually prevent me from getting COVID anyways, if I DO get COVID I will almost assuredly be fine (and likely won't even know it), and living in fear and acting on that fear is antithetical to being a free man and how I choose to live my life.

EDIT 2: I am pro-vax normally. Polio, MMR, etc. are all great. Tested and prevent horrible diseases. This one neither prevents something and COVID isn't horrible to most people. Maybe if I was 70 with several comorbidities...

"Probably gonna get the Fauci Ouchie
So, my grandfather, whom I lived with my senior year of high school and was/is a big impact on my life has taken a turn for the worst. He has been placed in a hospice care facility through the VA, a facility that only allows visitors that have been fully vaccinated. He has been given an estimated 6 months, which honestly, might be a stretch due to the severity and variety of health problems he has been battling with the last couple of years. Because of this, I am leaning towards abandoning most of my principles, along with all logic and reason, and getting the jab.

I see the writing on the wall, and while part of me wants to fight the overt implementation of global medical tyranny, the other part of me is tired of standing on principle in a world where it is scarce and wishes to take part in it no more. Hopefully, I will be fortunate enough to grow old with my fiance on a farm, traveling a world that denounces the neo-fascist attempts to enslave all of humanity to a life of subjugation and serfdom, but I'm okay if that isn't the case, as on some level I have felt like I've been on borrowed time since my first deployment to Iraq in 2006.

Regardless of whether I get the ""vaccine"" or not, I will continue to speak out against the curtailing of our civil liberties. As a request, I implore you all to hold out as long as you can; to stand on principle where my legs have become weak. Someone must be the control group in this dark experiment where multinational pharmaceutical corporations are making billions off the suffering of all humanity by way of coercion and threat of force. This is even more important now that we have learned these companies have intentionally destroyed the clinical trial control groups.

My second and last request from you all this day is that you are kind, not only to each other, but especially to those with differing views. At the end of the day, all but a few of us are just trying to do what we think is right. Seek dialogue, not debate, and choose love instead of hate. Try not to get sucked into the team mindset that makes it easier for elites to divide us and further consolidate power and wealth amongst themselves. I know it can be hard sometimes when it seems so many are against you, but darkness can only be defeated by light.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words and input. I was able to see my grandfather today. I took some things to him from the assisted care facility that he was previously at to his new residence. They didn't ask if I was vaccinated, only went down a checklist of questions regarding symptoms and took my temperature. Hopefully, this is how it remains and I am able to continue to see him without having to get the experimental ""vaccine."" I hate to think this, but I did have the thought that my mom maybe lied to me when she said they are only allowing vaccinated visitors in an attempt to try and pressure me into getting the shot. Either way, for now, all is well Again, thank you for your heartfelt responses. Be well.",-1

"Reasons why I'm not for the Vaccine/not Concerned with Covid

These are the reasons I am not ""For"" the Vaccine:

- If Covid was that bad, our politicians wouldn't have been travelling during Christmas 2020 if they were really fearful for their lives (this was before the vaccine roll out)

- There are parts of our world with high rates of who are experiencing their highest spikes in cases right now as we speak 

- we have health care workers (doctors/nurses) who work in the industry and yet even they question the short term/long term effects and effectiveness of vaccine (enough to put their careers at risk)

- Moderna/Pfizer profits off contracts, would they be incentivized to give us an inferior product so they can bill us once again for an updated and improved ""vaccine patch"". Remember these guys aren't liable if they screw up either. 

-If the side effects and risks are low and of no concern, why are we asked to conduct covid surveys to document if there we have any post jab symptoms? Yet the media seems to always brush things off as NBD. If side effects are in fact a risk, then I have to ask myself, which is worst, the possible long term side effects driven directly by the shot or catching the Rona and being in bed for a week, also with the possibility of long term health damages. 

- Usually before taking other jabs they ask if you're allergic to any of the ingredients in the meds, not with COVID shot, it's mandatory 

- I have this aching feeling in my mind telling me the Covid/VAX was intentionally released by USA/China. But I can't really pin it down - I don't think it's for depopulation, not to restrict freedoms  though",-1
"Why don't they have a different approach to anti-covid vaxxers?
Right now the main thing I'm hearing is to get your shot and while there are anti-vaxxers from before covid was even an issue, there seem to be a lot more anti-vaxxers who are mainly or only against getting the covid vaccine. My hypothesis is because of how the media and government has handled and politicized covid that has garnered this response. CMIIW but there seem to be lower vaccination rates in communities of colour and other lesser-privileged folks. Does anyone make a connection to the fact that minorities already have lower trust in medicine and the government because it has been used against them? Is there any rhetoric that has addressed these concerns and not grouped all anti-vaxxers together? I feel like the pressure to get the vaccine, while valid, has deterred a lot of people from it because of how it was approached by the media and government. 

Yes, people can do their own research but when the pandemic first started, and a few years prior, the distrust for the media grew (thank you Trump and Facebook) and there were no reparations done to gain back that trust. People who have deeply lost trust in the media, government, medicine, should still get vaccinated because it's not a political conspiracy or whatever, but how do you convince them otherwise?

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve taken a lot of ibuprofen and it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t help. Taking very deep breaths does help to an extent.

Is this normal? Do you have any advice?",0
"Intense fears weeks after 2nd Covid vax Pfizer
Hey everyone, I have (normally) well managed anxiety. 

I was nervous initially getting the vaccine but did some reading and spoke to friends and family in health care and decided the best protection for myself and others would be to do it.

That was almost 2 months ago (that I got the second shot). I was actually coping really well but recently in my state there has been a lot of things thrown around the vaccine and its long term effects and general fear tactics. Now I am normally a pretty rational person but I am really struggling with this constant bombardment and feel like I am dying (constant tight chest feelings and rapid heart rate). 

I am struggling to make plans because it feels silly because ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜what if I die?ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™.

Does anyone have any tips for managing the fears of the long term effects of the vax?

P.s. for those worried about the short term effects - they both affected me less than the flu jab. None for the 1st dose and body aches for the 2nd that lasted only one day.",0

"Pastor spreading dangerous lies (that are just his opinions) about COVID-Vaccine and the mark of the beast.
I used to watch this channel on youtube called 'christsforgiveness' and honestly it seemed like a pretty normal Christian channel. I thought that until I saw what Pastor David Lynn is advocating. He is against COVID regulations in Canada and even goes as far as to say the COVID-19 Vaccine is the mark of the beast or what he calls ""Mark of the 19""

His reasons for not taking ""The mark of the 19"" are not based on science and are really misinformed. He picks and chooses information that fits his agenda and moves with it. One of these reasons for not taking the vaccine is the fact that the vaccine does not give 100% immunity to COVID. No vaccine is 100% effective.

This type of preaching is extremely dangerous and foolish. Projecting your opinions as fact to people who trust you is wrong.

Please follow the advice given by your health services and do not listen to people with no credentials in science other than the fact that they are a pastor.",1
"Calling out the blatant lies...
We all know that the media likes to twist things or find those statistical rarities and present them in a way to make people believe that covid is killing everyone it infects. It's not too hard to read through the bs when it comes to those articles, but it's the articles where the ""facts"" that are being reported are absolute blatant lies that I just can't take anymore.

Case in point...

I work for a local hospital system in California. Part of my job is running analytics for the higher ups.  This morning I read an article in the newspaper on the topic of vaccines in which the president of our hospital system is quoted as saying ""not a single vaccinated person has been hospitalized for Covid since the beginning of the year."" 

That statement is complete and total bullshit. 

Here's the truth...

**Every single patient that is currently in the hospital for Covid has received at least one dose of the vaccine.** Every single one of them.  Now, granted half of them only received one dose of a two dose series, so technically they are not considered ""fully"" vaccinated, but what about the other half that received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine months ago.  They would be considered fully vaccinated, wouldn't they? 

How is this ok? Why are we not only hiding the full truth from the public, but actually blatantly lying to them?  Are they worried the truth will cause panic among all the people that foolishly believed that the vaccines were the answer? Worse, why are they STILL pleading with everyone to get vaccinated when they know the real statistics. I expect it from the government and the media at this point, but knowing that the lies being reported are coming from the actual hospitals, from the people that have taken an oath to ""do no harm"" is just absolutely maddening.",-1
"Please do not join in cornering obese people - it is part of the plan
I often see posts here saying we as NNN not wanting the vaccine are slim, fit and healthy whereas people taking the vaccine are fat and unhealthy. Please be careful with these kind of statements. Dividing the people in us versus them is all part of the plan. 

As an obese person I looked into it. Most people that died or got hospitalized from Covid have several conditions - 2 to 3 minimum - and often are older people.  

I am obese and am for freedom of choice for everyone. I am not taking the vaccine. 

I know it is better to have a healthy weight  and am working on it. 
But other than that I am healthy, I  have no other conditions, I do not smoke, I hardly ever drink alcohol, I hardly ever eat meat or fast food, I exercise daily (although frankly I could do more), I eat lots of fruit and vegetables and often buy ecological food.
Other than may be a one or two days cold every now and then I am never ill.
I know quite a few slim people that have a more unhealthy lifestyle or are more often ill.

Starting now with vaccine passports and a segregation of people into vaccinated and unvaccinated (for some considered healthy versus unhealthy) I believe this is just a beginning of more and more control and segregation. 

Now the voices are already talking about: no (free) health care for unvaccinated people. 
In the future they may add all kind of other information in this Covid passport 'health app'. 
Like weight, like smoker - non-smoker, drinker-non-drinker etc etc 
Who doesn't have at least one unhealthy habit? 

I think the most dangerous thing that is happening now is the segregation of people. 
I can understand people choose to get vaccinated, especially with the pressure going on. 
But I do fear for people accepting passports, accepting sharing private information, accepting (or even cheering on) segregation. 
If we accept this, what is the next thing to accept? 
With all pointing fingers towards obese people (without mentioning they are at risk especially in combination with diseases such as diabetes or high blood pressure) I feel that is may be the next thing they will focus on. 

This is a group of aware people. Please do not go along in any of these efforts to divide us. 
Even the people going along in this all they are just naive, they are not the enemy. 

My personal view is emotional health is the main component in being healthy in general. Non of this all is helpful for that. 
Lockdowns, social distancing and setting people up against each other are serious threats to emotional health and wellbeing and this will take its toll on health in general - now or in the future.",-1

"Serious question- for those that chose to not get the Covid vaccine, why come to the hospital?
Just curious. I work in the South, and see many Covid patients all the time. I ask as part of my H&amp;P if they recieved the covid vaccine and they tend to look down and sheepishly say ""no"". They never fight or argue. Then they come to us, the very people they do not trust, to get help. Of course I help them the same as everyone. I am just curious why the same people who slam the medical professionals run straight to us when they don't believe what we are saying at all.

By the way, the treatment you will receive for having severe Covid is very very intense and has way more terrible side effects than the vaccine.

Sure, your arm will feel a pinch for 1 second, and then be sore for a day or two, and you may feel kinda crappy for a day (it is not a live virus so it is impossible to get Covid from the vaccine). By the way, all those symptoms you feel are simply caused by the immune system creating T cells to fight off Covid and is actually a good thing.  Normal immune reactions include low-grade fever, aches, etc that subside after a couple days.

I didn't love how that felt, but the alternative is possibly dying on a ventilator while facetiming your family, developing long-term lung disease or blood clots after having Covid, having a tube shoved down your throat and getting hospital acquired pneumonia, Cdiff, or MRSA from being in the hospital, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and all the side effects of the meds as well..... I just don't get it

I mean, downvote me all you want but we send scores of patients in body bags to the morgue that died of preventable disease all the time.  It ain't pretty, it ain't that treatable, and once you show up to the hospital with late-stage symptoms like a stubborn mule you are almost certainly a goner.",1

"Good Pfizer experience for 48M two months after COVID diagnosis
My husband is a 48 y/o male in good health, not overweight.  He caught COVID in mid-March of this year.  His experience with COVID was relatively mild.  He had about three days where he felt some medium intensity cold/flu like symptoms but never lost taste or smell.  Interesting side note: my 8 y/o daughter and I never caught it (as verified by two negative tests) even though we live in the same home and we were not isolated from him while he was having symptoms and before he tested positive.  

He had his first Pfizer COVID vaccine shot in late April.  He felt some fatigue for about a day after this shot, but no other symptoms.  Three weeks later in May he had his second shot and his only symptom was minor fatigue, but with lesser intensity and duration than with the first shot.  We were bracing for the worst case vaccine reactions for him, but actually his experience was better than mine with Moderna in April.  My Moderna experience also wasn't really that bad outside of the 36 hours after the second shot.

But doctors who apply the vaxx will be liable. So beware if you are a doctor, its a double edged sword. Legally, you will be under the bus, not anyone. I think this happened in nazi trials also.

"Yoga After Getting the Covid-19 Vaccine

"Paxlovid does not work ?? Why it is still treated for COVID?
 Reddit community,

&#x200B;

I wanted to share my recent experience with Pfizer's Paxlovid, and it's important to note that my perspective is based on personal encounters and facts as I experienced them.

&#x200B;

I'm a 38-year-old male living in Waltham, Massachusetts, and like many, I've been cautious about COVID since its emergence in late 2019. Despite practicing strict precautions, I contracted the virus in December 2023, even with the availability of multiple vaccines and treatments.

&#x200B;

I had received three doses of Pfizer's vaccine and was treated with ""Paxlovid"" upon diagnosis of the COVID-19 variant JN.1 on December 8, 2023. My doctor assured me that ""Paxlovid"" would reduce symptoms, but my experience didn't align with this expectation.

&#x200B;

I took six pills a day (3 in the morning, 3 in the evening) for five days, experiencing severe body ache, 100-101 fever, cough, and sneezing. Despite completing the course, my symptoms persisted, and I tested negative on December 14th, only to test positive again on December 10th.

&#x200B;

Here are some noteworthy points about Paxlovid that I discovered during my experience:

&#x200B;

1. \*\*Persistent Medicinal Taste:\*\* Your mouth tastes like medicine for the entire five-day duration of the treatment.

&#x200B;

2. \*\*Symptom Duration:\*\* Symptoms may persist for 4-5 days even while on Paxlovid.

&#x200B;

3. \*\*Risk of Rebound:\*\* There is a 50%-60% chance of a COVID rebound after taking Paxlovid.

&#x200B;

4. \*\*Financial Incentives:\*\* Pfizer receives $1400 per person for the five-day dose, whether or not individuals bear the cost personally.

&#x200B;

5. \*\*Effectiveness Concerns:\*\* Paxlovid may not work for 50-60% of COVID patients, based on anecdotal reports from various individuals in my neighborhood.

&#x200B;

These observations led me to question the effectiveness and true purpose behind Paxlovid, making me wonder if it's more of a money-making business model than a reliable treatment option.

&#x200B;

I share this not to discourage anyone from seeking medical advice or treatment but to provide a firsthand account that may prompt others to explore various perspectives and options. Stay informed and safe, everyone!",-1

Give it some time because there will be many legal challenges to this since it is NOT currently FDA approved and still under Emergency Use Authorization (which stipulates it must be voluntary).

Personally, we are not willing to experiment with mRNA or adenovirus vaccines and waiting for, watching, and hoping the upcoming protein subunit NOVAVAX vaccine receives EUA soon as this TYPE of vaccine is less experimental as there are other protein subunit vaccines being used today.

"Swollen sore lymph node above the collar bone post COVID vaccine
[27 y/o 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™10 white male] I received my second shot of the Moderna vaccine this past Friday (first shot only side effect was sore arm). Saturday I was feeling sick pretty much all day with a fever, chills, and headache. My neck area was sore on the left side and I noticed a lymph node was swollen and sore on my collar bone (supraclavicular lymph nodes). By Sunday I was no longer sick, but the swollen lymph node never went away and still have it today, and size hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t gone down at all. I called the pharmacist who administered the vaccine about it and they made it seem like it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t a very common reaction and should see a doctor if doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t go away in next day or two. Has anyone experienced something similar post COVID vaccine? Is this a normal side effect? Only worries me because I know swollen lymph nodes in this area specifically are pretty abnormal.",0

"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!
(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!",1
"Even if you only use the mainstream reporting of the statistics you can see the vaccine is making Covid worse. Just look at the fact that we are seeing new ""waves"" of cases in highly vaccinated countries... in the middle of f*cking summer!
It's kind of crazy this isn't being reported on but we know that viruses like covid die down in the summer when the sun is greatest and people get out side more. This is evidenced last year when we saw the numbers drop in every country.

Why then are we experiencing new waves in the summer this year? Something that never happens with viruses or the flu for example. The only difference is we have the clot shots this year. If we are seeing a new wave in the summer just imagine how things are going to get in the winter. This is unprecedented and should be proof enough to stop all vaccination efforts.",-1

My mom and me have never seen eye to eye politically, but I always considered her pretty logical, then I realized how wrong I was. Today she flipped out on me for suggesting, or asking why she wouldn't, take my niece to get tested for covid after a positive case in her class. The kids have all been told to stay home for 10 days, since a classmate tested positive. I simply asked the question, 'Why wouldn't you get her tested?'. She proceeded to tell me I want to take her freedoms, that I love the government, and would 'turn her into the Stazi' or whatever. I told her she sounded crazy, crazy like some of the people that have threatened me online for being pro-vaxx and not shutting up about it. She didn't care. All she had to say was, to 'Stay in my lane'. I hung up on her, then blocked her. I don't need that shit in my life anymore.

"AITB for telling my mom I wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t visit the family until she lets my little sisters get the COVID-19 vaccine
I (24M) have always had kind of a strained relationship with my mom, whose political views and religious beliefs donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t fall at all in line with mine. Since I moved out of her house a few years ago, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been a lot easier to keep disagreements civil, but her response to the pandemic has been progressively making that more difficult. She refuses to wear a mask in public or practice social distancing, and because sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s (somehow) still not contracted the virus, she wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t acknowledge how dangerous and damaging it actually is. Since the vaccines started rolling out, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been very clear about my intentions of getting vaccinated, and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been very clear about her intentions not to. Her concern is that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been no long-term study to document possible side-effects, and as a result of this concern, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not allowing my little sisters, who are both under 18, live with her, and WANT the vaccine, to get it. This has been a major point of contention in our familyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s relationship for weeks now, and 2 days ago I finally put my foot down and told my mom that I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be visiting the family at all until she allows my little sisters to get vaccinated. I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t very nice about it, admittedly. I told her she was being irresponsible and unfair and short-sighted before I gave her the ultimatum, to which she just replied ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœthat makes me sad, but if thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s really how you feel, I will respect your decisionÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. I told her it makes me sad too. Since then, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve just been second guessing myself on the whole thing and wondering if IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m actually in the wrong here. I know global health is obviously extremely important and ending the pandemic should be a cause thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s obviously morally right to contribute to, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m worried I might have just burned a bridge between myself and my family. Am I the buttface here? Please let me know.


TL;DR: My mom, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s an anti-masker with a bad habit of downplaying the dangers of COVID, wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t let my under-18 little sisters get vaccinated due to lack of long-term studies, even though my little sisters have voiced their desire to get vaccinated. So, I told my mom I wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t visit the family until she lets my sisters get the vaccine.",1

"Have a COVID vaccination a day before my assignments are due. I want to extend them but not sure if I can under my AAP.
Hey everyone,

So long story short I've got a COVID19 vaccination right in the middle of exam period, I can't delay it as it's a booster shot and I must take it 4-6 months after my second dose - it was booked well in advance. I've got 2 assignments due on the 5th of November, and an exam on the 9th.

Whilst I have not had any side effects with my past vaccinations, I do worry this booster shot may lead to some side effects (I'm immunocompromised) which may impact my exams. My 2 assignments due are weighted 10% and 50% - I plan to get an extension for them. I'm aware this might be the last date for subject submission, and my exam following will be the 9th, but would an extension under an AAP be plausible under this situation? I'm going to be graduating this year if nothing goes wrong, but I do worry this may negatively affect me and make me fail pharmacology (60% exam, current H3 avg score with 15% unknown).

Controversial topic but one does not get vaccinated for the chicken pox if they had the chicken pox. If you had covid, being able to decline the vaccine seems reasonable.

So if anyone out there has had covid and is worried about the vaccine, donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not a guarantee that youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll get sick from it. It seems like side effects are all over the board and itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s just random as to whether you are really affected. Some of my coworkers (ages ranging from 20s to 60s) were pretty sick the day after, others had only mild effects, and others like me were completely fine. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not sure thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s any rhyme or reason as to who gets sick from it. 

Good luck everyone!",1

I live in a country that recently allowed pregnant women to get the Covid vaccine without a prescription.

"Covid Vaccine and increased risk of autoimmune disease?
I was reading this article https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833091/
and I started to get really worried about getting the vaccine. The article talks specifically about the mRNA vaccines and how the mechanism may cause an increase in autoimmune disease. The author recommend that people with autoimmune diseases or who are predisposed, to carefully weight the potential drawbacks and benefits before getting vaccinated. However, it has also been suggested that getting Covid could also cause an increased risk in developing autoimmune diseases. I read an article that stated 50 percent of a studied group of hospitalized covid patients had autoantibodies. It is also suspected that long covid is an autoimmune consider. But at least I feel like I can somewhat control my exposure to covid, while getting the vaccine feels like walking directly into a storm....

Everything was super quick and easy, I was in and out in about 30 minutes (including the 15-min post-shot wait), everyone at the pharmacy was super nice (which, tbh, is kinda rare at pharmacies these days), and they had my next appointment already setup when I was done.

Update 2: My husband got a call today (a day after I got my shot) about an extra dose and was able to get the first shot this afternoon and appointment for a second one, we honestly did not expect that to happen. He even said there was couple behind him that also got the call about extra doses, so this pharmacy is worth checking out.

"Meh... I'm not too worried.
The powers that be have bitten off ***much*** more than they could chew.   


Think about how difficult it was to enforce mask mandates. There were people getting killed (not agreeing with it, btw) for telling folks to put their masks on. Imagine a store owner telling someone who is starving and have to feed their family that they can't buy food because they haven't injected themselves with an experimental injection. I *guarantee* people will start getting violent to get their basic necessities met. People are going to lose their jobs and get desperate. Remember, crime is inversely proportional to opportunity!  


A door-to-door vaccine campaign *WILL* (not might) end up with people getting shot!

You don't have enough law enforcement to be everywhere all the time. 

Also, in some places, they're trying to mandate kids wear masks in schools. You can barely get these kids to sit in their seats for 5 minute spans, do you think they're gonna compromise their oxygen for 6+ hours a day?

Rebellions happen for a reason; because humans are not meant to be subjugated and mistreated for too long.

I personally know of a few people who have taken one shot or two shots of the Pzifer vaccine. Most of these people do not seem to have experienced any ill side effects.

Her face swelled up really bad, and emergency services were called.

"Should the unvaccinated cOVID patients receive lower priority for care?
As those who refused to get vaccinated fill ICUs and emergency rooms, their presence is killing people with normal emergencies as hospitals are forced to turn the non-COVID patients away.

Personally I think if you refused to be vaccinated, you aren't entitled to priority treatment above others who need the space. Obviously I mean adult patients, not children with no power to demand vaccination.

If a person with life-threatening injuries from accident, or with pre-existing conditions such as cancer, epilepsy, asthma, etc. needs medical help, why should they get a lower priority of care over people who harmed themselves for political reasons?

""I refused to protect myself or my community cuz 'Merika!, goddammit, but now I'm sick and I demand first priority of treatment"" seems to me the height of entitlement and hubris.

Why should these people be allowed to break the hospitals' capacities and endanger others further? It just encourages more vaccine resistance when people know that if they should get sick, they will get priority care over others.

Hospitals should reserve a number of beds and supplies for non-COVID patients. If any sick people are to be turned away, let the unvaccinated be the first. They deliberately chose their fate.",1

"What's your strategy in the face of mandates?
In my very liberal state the mandates are slowly getting extended.  So far government employees and healthcare workers have been coerced but have the option of weekly (out-of pocket) testing, or get fired without the possibility of unemployment compensation, (as per hearsay).  Locally, some counties are trying to extend vax requirements for dining out, which will probably end up in bankruptcy for the few restaurants still left.  Schools will be in-person and mask mandatory for children(!) and teens.  What's worse maybe, I can't decide, is that much of the private sector, especially the corporate sector, is making vax mandatory as a condition for continued employment.  

It's pretty obvious that this is getting closer and closer to home for many people, if it hasn't hit already.  So, what are some of the strategies people are coming up with?  So far the options seem to be:

Lying.  This doesn't feel good and only works where no proof is required.

Explaining that it's private medical information and disclosure is optional.  So, 'none of your business'.

The truth, a*nd why*.   So, endless arguments and self-outing oneself as a pariah with consequent loss of friendships and ""privileges"".

My cousin works for big pharma. He has access to real data and knows a few people who work for Moderna. According to a Moderna insider less than 4% of the vaccines contain the vaccine.

Those few people who end up getting the real thing twice get very sick and some die from it.  He said Moderna didn't even have the capacity to manufacture the mRNA vaccines at such a short time if 100% of the vaccines were the real thing. They are mixing the real 4% with all the placebos.

"COVID Vax at Rocklea Writeup
Hey all, 

Thought I would briefly share my experience having my COVID shot today. 

I am in none of the priority groups and just signed up on the Queensland Health [vaccine registration site](https://www.vaccinebookings.health.qld.gov.au/registerforvaccination/) on 29 May after seeing a post here. On 2 June I got a message saying I could register to actually get the vaccine (they send you a link for this registration). Once I created an account most of my details were pre-filled and I could choose where I wanted to receive the shot. Altogether very smooth. 

I arrived at the Showgrounds and was prompted at the gate to show my registration QR code. I don't know if they were accepting people who hadn't registered but it seemed everyone there had pre-registered. Then we headed in for a two-step bit of admin where they asked basic questions like name and age. I also had a fill in a form with much of the same info I had previously recorded online. You're also given a small card that records when you received your first dose and a reminder to get your second within 3 weeks. Everyone was ***extremely*** nice and helpful. We were all given stickers with our appointment times on and then we waited in a short line (maybe 15 people?). 

The shot itself was just like any other. After that they make you wait for 15-minutes and that's it! From arriving to leaving, including the 15 post-shot observation, was 35 minutes. Incredibly smooth. 

If you are thinking of getting your shot I really recommend going for it. I felt really good afterwards and the friendly, professional manner of everyone there made it a seamless, stress-free process.

 After my 1st Moderna vaccine in early March I was breathing like 70% better later that day. Stopped needing my rescue inhaler.

Second Moderna dose was 4/6.

"Fever for 14 days straight since covid shot
23Y Female

Title says it all. I got my second covid shot May 23rd. I felt fine the day of but I woke up the next day with a fever of 102.3. since then my temperature has varied from 101.2-103.9.

I feel fine other then a small cough but my temperature is still running at 103. Not sure if this means my body is still fighting the virus but 2 weeks is a long time to be feverish and have no other symptoms right? 

Not sure if it's just a harmless side effect from the vaccine or if I should go get checked. 

Any advice is appreciated!",0
"Irregular period after COVID vaccine
Hey all, I (21 YRS) have experienced a change in my period ever since I received the first dose of the COVID vaccine. 

For some background my periods were irregular for the first couple of years but has been stable the past year and a half. I am not and have never taken birth control and I do not take any other medications. I typically have longer cycles 34-37 days. My longest cycle to date had been 37 days with normal flow lasting about 6 days but experiencing very painful cramps the first couple of days of my period. 

On March 16 I received my first COVID shot (moderna) later that month my period was about 4 days late which scared me a little bit bc as I mention my longest cycle had been 37 days but this one was 41 days, however I know that other factors affect periods as well such a stress, physical activity, weather, etc. So I did not think much of it. 

On April 16th I received my second shot. Later this month I was due for my period and I was even later this time making my cycle about 44 days long. Another change was also a decrease in pain experienced with cramps. I thought this out and realized the only factor that has changed is getting the COVID vaccine since I am not stressed or really doing anything differently than I have been the past year. If anything when I have been very stressed my period has never been that late. 

Has anyone else noticed changes in their periods after receiving any of the COVID vaccines ?",0

Sorry for yet another vaccine question (know there have been a LOT recently...).

I had the Astra Zenica vaccine on Monday. Felt pretty okay all day other than funny feeling arm (no pain, swelling, redness or stiffness), very tired later in the evening, then some chills and fever and aches in my legs overnight. Worse vaccine reaction I've personally ever had but standard stuff. Took two lots of standard dose paracetamol at two points in the night and then some ibuprofen because I needed to sleep and the paracetamol was doing nothing for my aching legs. Felt pretty okay yesterday except tired from not sleeping.

Then woke up this morning (a full 48 hours since vaccine) and my whole upper arm on the side I got the vaccine is really stiff and sore. I think it has got worse throughout the day-it is now aching into the top of my shoulder and the junction between my neck and shoulder. Would seem pretty standard if I'd started getting it before but seems weird for it to crop up today when I'm over everything else. I've had similar aches with flu jabs, but it kicks in a few hours after. Again, would not feel weird if it had set in gradually, but was not experiencing these symptoms at all yesterday (even weird feeling in arm had gone) so yeah, seems odd.

Do I have any reason to be concerned?",0
"Shift to a highly obedient, facist society.
After reading some posts about people planning on quitting their jobs, the military etc in a month.  Think about it.  This division about the vaccine is meant to weed out the critical thinkers in all aspects of society.  If all the people who chose not to take the vaccine leave the military, who is left?  Highly agreeable and obedient soldiers.  The people who take the vaccine because everyone else did, and the authority figures in my life told me to do it.  These people will have no problem forcing people to do whatever the ""authorities that be"" say people should do based on ""science.""  As long as our educational systems keep pumping out highly agreeable completionists, instead of critical thinkers who think for themselves, we are doomed.

"Any references for good antibody response after Covid vaccine if on TNFi?
Edit for clarification: I am scheduled to get the vaccine next week, I am 110% on board with getting it, everyone should get it, I've been looking forward to this for a looong time, I just want to have a sense of how effective it might be for someone on TNFi bc all we hear are the amazing stats for regular folks. I think the flu shot is amazing and worth it even though that may only be \~50% effective in a given year, I just think the knowledge is important to have. Most importantly, **my gut feeling is that the Covid vaccine will be really great still even if on TNFi-- I bet the numbers are still incredibly high, and I'm expecting a ton of reassurance when they come out**. I'm not posting this as a ""ugh it isn't going to work and it won't be worth it"" -- I'm coming from exactly the opposite perspective when I ask if anyone has seen numbers.

original:

My family is trying to tell me that the Covid vaccine won't work for me because I'm on a TNFi (Humira). There was an article about people on immunosuppressants due to solid organ transplant showing very low antibody response to the vaccine, and they are fear-mongering me about it, basically saying that I'll never be able to live a normal life and frankly everyone with this illness has had those fears and it's NOT an OK button to push. I assume those patients in the article were on methotrexate and/or something else, they wouldn't be on Humira for organ transplant, and these are very different medications. The guidelines for vaccination on TNFi say you don't need to alter your dosing schedule, but they do recommend changing it if you're on Mtx-- I assume because of this.

I get the reasons why this article wouldn't be directly applicable to me, a person on TNFi, but I would love to know **has anyone has seen any data on % of patients getting strong antibody response from Covid vaccination while on TNFi?** I am really mad that my family is fear-mongering, it's unhelpful and feels unsupportive and nasty. I am also a scientist, though, and some cold hard data on the vaccine working for people on TNFi would go a long way to icing my wounds :-)",1
"To those medical professionals who spread misinformation about covid/ the covid vaccine and refuse to comply with the new vaccine mandate, shame on you
With the new vaccine mandate set to occur at the end of October, our residency program is going to feel the squeeze of losing several staff members. Many of who are medical staff such as MAs or nurses who help our clinic and hospital run. Multiple employees have openly stated they refuse to get the covid vaccine and as a result, will be terminated by the end of October. 

All I can say is, shame on you. This goes for ALL medical professionals declining the vaccine. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re causing an already stressed medical system to crash and burn. We have people of all ages with covid in the hospital, ICU, and clinic in varying stages of the disease. Our hospital is full and our ED is diverting people. Our ICU is full and we have a hell of a time trying to get anyone into the ICU because itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s completely full. Normal patients who would be a slam dunk ICU transfer are now relegated to the floor because weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re maxed out. And this is all before the vaccine mandate takes place and we lose even more staff.

So thank you. Thank you for being so stubborn that youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re willing to let more people die and let your colleagues take on even more of a burden because youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re too selfish to get a vaccine.

YouÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d see physicians stressed to the point of collapse. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d see RTs and RNs burnt out from another futile case but continuing to provide the best care they can.

"Can we talk about the covid vax and the weird dreams people are having afterwords.
So I'm at work a week or two ago and I overhear one of the guys saying that they are having the most fucked up dreams after the moderna shot.  I brush it off because that's pretty weird.  Then yesterday I hear another guy telling the 1st guy about how fucked up his dreams have been so they were sharing how weird and vivid they've been and both were saying that they had never previously remembered their dreams or only on rare occasions. They both were saying that they keep dying, almost dying or being seriously injured in their dreams. The one guy said every night, the other guy said most nights they are having these crazy dreams. 

So I do a quick Google search and as I'm typing ""weird dreams"" the google autofill pops up with weird dreams after covid vaccine. There's been some stories written about it but mainly just articles with social media posts.  No explanations that I could find. So I yell over to them start typing weird dreams and look what the autofill brings up.  Obviously they were surprised but not really phased.  This is how mind fucked people are. They care more about their pencil point breaking then how an experiment they're part of has made something in their brain change. 

This should scare the hell out of everyone. How and why the hell is this happening?  This means it's effecting people's fucking brains somehow.  Crazy times were in.

"Covid vaccine caused autoimmune response- or something else?
Hello,
I'm a 15 yr old Asian female, 115 lbs and 5'3. I do not smoke or drink and do not use recreational drugs, I currently am not on any medications, and I do not have any (diagnosed or identified) pre-existing medical conditions.

Ever since receiving my second covid vaccine in June (which caused me severe chest pain and inflammation, and a trip to the ER during which they injected toradol into me) I have been plagued with a sudden onset of body changes I have never experienced before.

These include frequent urination, vaginal dryness(?), new huge floaters and flashes in my vision, stinging eyes, decreased vision in darkness, palinopsia (afterimages), headaches and migraines, and crackly joints. I have also had changes in my menstrual cycle.

I have noticed that specific triggers can cause these symptoms to flare up, such as crying, cold, and holding in urine. 

Most of the time I do not have all these symptoms at once and they alternate between localized discomfort at my eyes (with the stinging and red eyes) and lower regions (frequent urination. etc.) depending on which trigger. 

I am sure the covid vaccine either caused my current condition, or I have already had this condition and the vaccine intensified it. To clarify, I am pro-vaccine, I just wonder if there is a correlation as these symptoms started after my vaccine shot. 

I have consulted my family doctor for suspecting a thyroid problem (I had already shown symptoms of this before the vaccine, and my mother, at my age also had those symptoms) and/or autoimmune problem. He performed a complete metabolic panel, plus a thyroid test and a test for the C reactive protein. Doctor said everything looked normal. 

I am still feeling these symptoms and not one day goes by without me worrying about my body. My parents have more or less stopped believing me and have labeled me a ""chronic complainer."" I know something is off. I want to return to the way I was before and find out what is wrong with me.

"I got the second Pfizer shot yesterday! The covid vaccine is the first vaccine I've ever gotten, and I will continue to be vaccinated for the rest of my life.
Dang did that second shot hurt! My arm is sore but other than that I honestly feel better than I have in over a year.

Initially I was nervous about having symptoms since I experienced fatigue and muscle aches from the first shot, but when I got home the only thing that happened was an insatiable hunger.

I ate a bowl of pasta, 3 eggs with toast, sunflower seeds, a Popeyes chicken sandwich, coleslaw, chocolate and a large DQ blizzard.

I could have eaten more. 

This is the first vaccine (that I know of) that I've recieved thanks to my loving husband. My mother is anti-vax and refuses to get the vaccine, and thankfully my dad got his behind her back.

I've never been more proud of him.

Don't give up everyone! We're getting there.

36F wondering what level the alarms on the blood pressure machine are set to go off 

I recently had my blood pressure sky rocket after getting my second shot. The alarms on the machine went off immediately and I was wondering what blood pressure level they are set to go off at?

"""We shouldn't have to flash a piece of ID saying we injected ourselves with a pharmaceutical substance every single time we enter a building or board a train.""
We don't need to be carrying around a dystopian card to live our lives. We shouldn't have to flash a piece of ID saying we injected ourselves with a pharmaceutical substance every single time we enter a building or board a train. 

That's NOT NORMAL, That's creepy and DYSTOPIAN. 

If you want the Covid-19 vaccine, then, take it for yourself and your kids. We're NEVER going to reach a hundred percent vaccinated, people like me have made up my mind like a stubborn mule that I will NEVER take the Covid-19 vaccine because I'm more at risk of it than the Virus itself which has a 99.8+% survival rate for people under 70. 

We should want normal back, none of this Vaccine Passport crap is 'Normal'...This idea won't even make sense in 2 years when the vaccines are outdated and useless.

I wasn't sure what to expect, because I'm on Ocrevus and it's doing it's job very well.

My shot was at 2:55 yesterday and the rest of the day went okay. When I woke up this morning I just felt a little meh, sore arm plus mild body aches. I already took the day off of work so I decided to move around some pallets of stuff in my garage and at about 11:00 (20hrs in) things got fun. Got the chills, the fever, a mild headache, and a little light headed. Then I lost feeling in my hands, all of my strength, and my walking and vision got real iffy like the pseudo flare thing. I went back to bed on an intermittent Tylenol and Gatorade regimen and it seems to have mostly passed now at 6:30PM.

Hopefully this means my body built up some sort of immunity to COVID.

"University of California Vaccine Mandates
I have been engaged in a dispute with the University of California, Santa Cruz, regarding their imposition of vaccine mandates upon the student body. I have successfully achieved a religious exemption from the mandate, though it was not without pushback from my end.

Now, being the far-left indoctrination center that UCSC is, my posts in r/ ucsc regarding this subject have been met with intense hate and discrimination regarding my religion and beliefs (ironic, that an institution which ""celebrates"" ""diversity, inclusion and acceptance,"" would in fact have no room for those qualities when it comes to differing perspectives). My posts have been removed, censored, or muted. I thought I would share with this group the kind of content that results in exclusion from a subreddit dedicated to an academic institution, as well as give this text a home. (Note: this is my first post to this subreddit after spending a month or so as an infatuated observer and participant of discussion. I hope this content is permitted).

From my original post:

""I recently created a post regarding religious exemption/exception for the experimental COVID Vaccines being mandated upon the student populace (and I must mention, the mods removed my post with no explanation, and responses in the comments were filled with hate and bigotry). As a Catholic and a human being with the God-given right to personal autonomy, I personally find this mandate absolutely abhorrent. I must make it clear that I am not inherently opposed to vaccines, though I do believe the individual reserves the right to choose what goes into their body and should not be coerced, manipulated or threatened to lose certain rights and abilities based on something such as vaccination status. Let me say that again: *the individual reserves the right to choose what goes into their body and should never be coerced, manipulated or threatened to lose certain rights and abilities based on something such as vaccination status. No matter what.*

This is not only a deeply held religious belief of mine, but it is in fact the most American belief there is in regards to freedom of personal choice and bodily autonomy. To comply with this mandate would be to surrender ourselves to the most vile government intrusion this nation has observed.

It cannot be denied that the implementation of covid vaccine mandates across the country and world is leading us, as a global people, to a very dark place. If you've been paying attention, you may have noticed massive anti-""vaccine passport"" protests rising up across Europe, including in France, Italy, and Lithuania (and now New York City). I applaud these protests. We, as a global people, are actively witnessing or participating in the transformation of a democratic ideal into one of pure authoritarianism, discrimination, hate and tyranny. This global pandemic, which was either leaked or released from a gain-of-function virology laboratory in Wuhan, China, has set a horrid precedent regarding individual liberties and the powers of individuals in government, whether elected or appointed. This virus, the novel covid-19, the seventh known coronavirus to infect man, has become the demise of our great nation. And that is not because of the virus itself, but rather, massive government overreach and over reaction to something that is barely fatal and much less dangerous than it was initially assumed to be. If it isn't apparent to you how covid-19 has been used to control, manipulate, and deceive the American people, I suggest you break free from the cognitive shackles imposed upon you by our national media and government officials. This whole narrative is a farse, they are actively deceiving you to force your compliance.

It is commonly understood that powers given to governments are powers forever lost to that nation's people. There is extensive literature regarding this phenomena. The post-9/11 Patriot Act is a great example. To this day, illusive government agencies are still spying on the American people, breaching their private lives and evading basic privacy rights. The Patriot Act allowed this imposition upon our people's private lives, and it was passed in 2001. 20 years have passed, and they still continue to neglect our privacy rights in the name of national security. It is clear as day: if we continue to allow these government interventions into our personal lives, the destruction of our civil liberties will continue to persist. Our compliance is our submission. Our submission is our demise.

So with this, I am pleased to inform the student body at UCSC: religious exemption is possible for those who do not wish to trade their bodily autonomy for the ability to attend higher education. I have gone through the process, successfully, but with some push-back, I must admit. Be prepared to stand up for what you truly believe in, and you will find support through God. Students of UCSC, if you cannot decide whether or not you will take this vaccine, I urge you: look deep inside of yourself. Trust your intuition. Know that behind each corner lies another deception, a trick, an illusion designed to force your will. Resist the narrative. It is the greatest deception many of us have ever witnessed in our entire lives, and it will continue only so long as we comply. This is merely a test. The government has asked for an inch, and they have taken a mile. And they will continue to do so until we find ourselves in complete submission and subservience to their wicked will.

If you are someone who is considering no longer attending this school due to the mandates imposed by the UC body, please do not hesitate to apply for religious exemption. If you need help through the process, feel free to reach out to me through a PM and I will happily support you through the process.

God bless America. We are one of the final bastions of freedom in the world. And should we continue to comply with the will of the wicked, we may very well see our beloved nation fall into the grips of authoritarianism; medical-tyranny, so to speak. Have faith, my friends. The fight is not over yet.""

Now, am I surprised that I was muted and my post removed? Definitely not. Is it a sign of the active attempt to shut down those who speak against this medical tyranny, this ideological hegemony? Absolutely. I am deeply disturbed by the current state of our political and social discourse. As a young man in his early twenties, I must admit that I am quite uncomfortable with the direction our nation and the world is headed. I am also deeply concerned with the willingness of my peer group to conform to the will of the wicked. These are dark times.

My plans for the future, in regards to higher education, were almost completely de-railed by these mandates. I have seen dozens, if not hundreds of posts in this subreddit by people who face a very similar predicament: *get the jab, or lose your job, your ability to participate in society, and the respect of your peers.* We are not alone. This is affecting hundreds of millions of Americans, and even many more millions of human beings across the world. We must stand up for what we truly believe in, because as far as I am concerned, we are the only thing standing between the state, and full-blown top-down authoritarianism (I refrain from employing the terms fascist or communist here, as I am sure none of us are truly aware as to what the exact qualities and conditions this New World Order will be). The time is now. We are being tested. Hold your will, remain strong. We will resist the New Normal!

"Covid has shown us that, Kiwis are sheltered. It's sad but true.

The anti-lock down and anti vaccine sentiment in my opinion is in part (not 100%) a byproduct of our very cushiony life down here. 

The people who are complaining about lock down and oppression have never seen true oppression. Likening level 3 (or level 2) lockdown to the holocaust is ignorant at best and down right inhuman at worst. 

All the anti vaxxers have never been through a deadly pandemic. Asian vaccination rate is like 99%. They have lived through Sars and MERS etc. They know its bad. They get vaccinated.

Kiwi's for the most part have never seen tyrannical oppression. Never seen a deadly virus rip through our community. Rarely experience life changing natural disasters. Our experience with violent crime is next to nothing. The country as whole experiences abiut the same  murders in an entire year than Chicago does in a week. We have access to clean water, electricity, shelter, WiFi and uber eats. We are a very lucky and blessed first world country. 

Some of these people need a wakeup call. You are not oppressed, there is no government conspiracy to mind control you. Stay home, get vaccinated and move on with your life.

Part of me wishes that
A. The vaccine was 100% effective and
B. Delta was 20x more lethal.

When 1,000 UN-vaccinated people go belly up while vaccinated peeps are sitting pretty, might motivate a reality check and get some butt's in seats at the vaccination centre. But because our Covid strategy has been working, infection rates are low, deaths are even lower, people are allowed to ignore reality and stay in thier delusion bubble.

"My (32F) wife (31F) says I am dismissing her trauma related to death by getting a covid vaccine
So you can see my post history and how my wife wants us to wait to get COVID vaccines. Since the last post, we agreed to open discussion again when a local drive thru site opened at the end of the month. Well the end of the month is here and it's open. I made an appointment for next week.

This set off another argument. She is still terrified that the vaccine will kill me, a young, relatively healthy person in their 30s. She has this huge trauma related to her brother's death when she was a teenager. At the time, she was in an abusive situation at her mother's house, and her older brother offered to let her move in with him and take care of her. He died in a tragic accident shortly before she was due to move in.

So now she's experiencing fear due to this trauma. At the moment she is financially dependent on me because she has been unable to get a job since moving to be with me. So she feels a lack of control and a similar situation to being stuck at her mother's house.

So once again, I said that I am confident that the vaccine will not kill me. She says this is denying her trauma. I said no, I am not denying that you went through a trauma, but this is my health, my body, my choice. And she says that this is her biggest trauma, her biggest fear, and she needs more time to go through therapy and deal with it so she can feel okay about me getting the vaccine. It's also not just my body my choice because if I die it affects her. If I were to get the vaccine, she would feel nonstop anxious for weeks waiting to see if it killed me. She said she wants me to be able to get it, but just not yet. Maybe not until full FDA licensing, which could be months away. 

She did bring up the valid point that if I were to die, she wouldn't know what to do financially. I assured her that I have enough life insurance and in my retirement accounts to take care of her for many years. I am working on putting together information about all my accounts for her and finally getting my will in order so that my house will pass to her without any legal issues. 

However, I'm tired of waiting to get the vaccine. I reassured her that after getting the vaccine, I am not going to rush to see people or anything. But I too have anxiety which manifests as catastrophic thoughts, and there's a constant worry in the back of my mind that something will happen out of my control (I fall down the stairs, car accident, whatever) and I won't be protected. For my own anxiety, I want to get the vaccine as soon as I can. I feel like I've done my waiting, I've already compromised, and I don't want to compromise anymore. She says I have to compromise if I want to be in a relationship.

Now it seems straight up mean to just be like ""I'm going to get my vaccine now, see you later."" I genuinely do not want to put her through weeks of torment. But I want this vaccine! I feel it's the best decision for my health. My therapist says it was one of my goals to stand up for myself more and suggested this as an opportunity. I agreed and I feel 100% confident that getting the vaccine is a good decision for me personally.

I don't want to dismiss her trauma, but saying I should wait to get the vaccine is completely irrational. Anxiety isn't rational. I want to be a good partner and not cause her anxiety, but this just seems ridiculous to me. I am willing to wait perhaps two more weeks but I really don't want to. I just want some more outside perspective here.",1

"COVID vaccine is being pushed by those who stand to profit (opinion)
Itâ€™s not a matter of smart vs stupid when talking about getting the vaccine. Available COVID vaccines are indeed novelty and will be for some time but thatâ€™s not even the issue. People get the vaccine and turn around and catch the virus weeks later. People take the vaccine and become asymptomatic and carry on with false confidence and spread the virus. Mask mandates are an indecisive fad, and if we do need to be wearing masks regardless of vaccine status (I believe we do), then why push the vaccine with the vigor of righteousness like your trying to save lives? If you have underlying health issues or are at risk in any way, GET THE VACCINE. Otherwise, itâ€™s a personal decision and youâ€™re not harming anyone by not getting it. The cost of each dose ranges from 10 to 37 bucks each. Someone (we the tax payers) is footing the bill. There are very tangible financial consequences to this hysteria and I truly donâ€™t feel like those pushing the agenda have the right to be so confident while doing so. Itâ€™s not like other viruses. Itâ€™s not like recent pandemics. Stop making the comparison. We have social responsibilities that cannot be substituted with a vaccine meant for rapid response. 

TL;DR get the vaccine if you need it. Donâ€™t stop wearing a mask. The vaccine is not a miracle solution that can rid us of our social responsibilities to each other.

"I have inside information about pilots refusing the vaxx
Honestly, I am worried to be talking about this but this subreddit seems very one sided and a place I can trust. Looking at how crazy the world is getting right now im okay with sharing.
My dad is a captain for delta airlines. Unfortunately he praises the media and is pro vaxx. However, we talk about his job quite a lot and I recently saw a couple of the lists that airlines have in case they need a pilot on short notice. My dad just recently became a captain so his seniority is quite low, meaning he doesnt often get the chance to take these trips. Recently that has changed and im sure most of you already know where this is going. He had a few days off but started getting alerts non stop about these trips being offered to him ever since airlines have started forcing vaccines on their employees and pilots. At first when I saw this I just thought it was coincidence, but research and some thinking made me realize it isnt coincidence at all.
Pilots are walking out at a higher rate than ever. On multiple lists I saw there were a few people ahead of him declining trips (ones with the vaxx probably) and then under him are a majority of pilots titled as ""not qualified"" (pilots refusing the vaxx), something I have never seen before. The airlines deny it and cover it up as many different reasons, but the real reason to me is clear as its just happening now that the jab is being mandated. The media wont share this either obviously.
The rates at which people are denying the jab is much more than any media will say or most people think. In an important, more liberal job like pilots and airline employees, the rate is much lower than most career fields but from what ive seen, if I had to put a number on it, I would say upwards of 65% are refusing the jab.
I wanted to share this to anyone hesitant about getting it if their job depends on it. DO NOT GIVE IN, WE ARE THE MAJORITY. This vaxx is dangerous and long term effects could be detrimental. Stand up for the constitution and our freedoms and please, please, protect your family from it as well.

"New York Times admits Corona is getting its Mutant powers from the bodies of the Vaccinated
[NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/01/us/covid-santa-monica-icu.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage)

Heres the part of particular interest. 

""While vaccinated people appear to be getting far less sick from infections, the superior powers of the Delta variant are allowing the virus to proliferate in their systems and to[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/health/cdc-vaccinated-delta.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage)spread, lethally, to the unvaccinated.""

&amp;#x200B;

Im just a regular Joe. But this scamdemic has accidentally tipped Big Pharma's hand. Using our internet degrees, we all pretty much realize there were no reported mutations until the vaccines came out. Then they introduce a new vax tech with mRNA tomfoolery, and now several variants. We're going to see the L Loki variant pretty soon. Sorry, I need my sense of humor when talking about things Im deadly fucking serious about. 

It appears the vaccine is literally the cause of these mutations IN THE BODIES OF THE VACCINATED. The vaccine will be the end of many more of us. The mRNA vaccine may bring about a TRUE pandemic with the death toll hitting every family, and 50% or more of your family going down within this decade if the variants are allowed to run wild. Their answer to this is likely going to be new booster shots. I think we can just imagine the holy hell that will cause. We already know what the leaky spike proteins are doing. 

Im honestly confused why certain vaccines really do work, and are one and done, and yet vaccines like the flu shot and now Corona are chasing its tail, always a year behind. If we use the flu as a model, could it be that the flu shot has kept the flu alive all these decades? If we stop the flu shots, will it lose its ability to mutate in the vaccinated and keep going? If we stop the corona vaccine, will Corona stop mutating?

What Im about to say is deadly fucking serious, and the course of action is ONLY to be taken when certain countrywide conditions are met. Big Pharma may NEVER admit their vaccines are the reason viruses like Corona can mutate. If they continue their booster shot plan and keep a new shot going every year, they may literally kill 75% of the global population that once lived healthy in 2019. 

IF American (and any other country that reads this and wants to do the same) society LITERALLY falls apart because of the mass deaths hitting everyone, and IF the scientists and Big Pharma dont come to their senses and stop the vaccines on their own, then the Militia must reform and take aggressive action against the vaccine. Those who are still remaining, if the country has fallen apart, and its literal pandemonium in the streets because of out of control variants, you must DESTROY vaccine production and destroy EVERY supply of it like a fucking Revenuer looking for alcohol. That means armed invasions of hospitals, clinics, and store pharmacies, forcing them to hand over the vaccines for destruction. That means armed invasions of vaccine manufacturing plants. You dont need to kill anyone in these locations, a show of force will be enough, and if you overwhelm local law enforcement, if its even still functioning in that month, there will be little resistance. If it takes burning down vaccine manufacturing plants, so be it. 

Im not calling for this action any time soon. Because you know, terrorism charges and all that. Youll know the day you need to rise up and act. When that day comes, society will likely have already devolved into literal Civil War, with one side killing each other, blaming them for the variants. While the scared and angry are out killing each other, groups of smart people need to carry out these strikes against the vaccine and its spike protein super power giving ability if the government is still trying to distribute that shit, and all you have noticed is the variants are just running wild and deadlier year after year. I may not be around to start this contingency plan myself. Who knows if the virus gets me too, I havnt had it yet. Read this, remember it. Use your common sense.  

The government has shown they are NOT looking out for our health. We have the evidence the vaccine is making things worse right before our eyes. Theyre already admitting it, even in liberal rags, yet enforcing the vax left and right to work jobs and travel. If the governments wont save us, and stays on the Big pharma payroll making things progressively worse year after year with this particular virus, then this strike plan against the vaccine production must be taken.   

For now we can only cross our fingers, hope Big Pharma and Big Science comes to its fucking senses and fixes the shit they unleashed on the world, and hopefully our natural immunity saves most of us, and the mRNA spike protein powered super variants arent enough to kill 50% or more of us in a true pandemic. Ive always said I'll play nice and maintain my perfect spotless criminal record until shit gets really real. When each of us notice 50% or more of our family and friends going down to Corona, Shit is officially Real then. That is the day you act to Save Humanity.",-1

This is both dangerous for long-term studies but fundamentally anti-science in every way.

Maybe that control group has been eviscerated, but one control group remains for the long-term studies of the vaccine(s): the unvaccinated. That's right, comparing the unvaccinated to the vaccinated allows us to gauge the positive and negative effects of the vaccine(s).

But all the high-pressure sales tactics of the past few months are specifically aimed to destroy to the control group that is the unvaccinated. Why are they doing this? The answer lies in the fact that when we see negative side effects of the vaccine, they can claim coincidence instead of a direct link to the vaccines. 

The smaller the control group, the less trustworthy anyone looks claiming the vaccines cause harm. But why are they trying to rush this process? Because they know the side effects are starting now and will only display themselves more shortly. VAERS shows this, r/covidvaccinated shows this, and Israeli data is showing to show the failures of the vaccines, too.

"I spent like an hour writing this reply to someone in another thread and I'd like your thoughts on it as well. I try not to seek external validation but sometimes I feel like I'm crazy for suggesting that long term studies are important.
I am more than happy to share my views. Thank you for being willing to listen. A few things I want to get out of the way first, I’m 23 years old. I am not an expert in anything. I don’t claim to be and don’t try to be. If anything I’d say that I know enough to be sure that I don’t know anything. I should also mention that I have always had a general distrust to the government/media/authority telling me what to do without question. 

That being said I do have some thoughts on everything. 

Why long term studies? 

Vaccines (and pharmaceuticals in general) typically go through a lengthy approval process. From initial research to three phases of trials with various standards and expectations. The majority of medications do not make it past Phase I of their respective studies. This source says 7.9% have a likelihood of approval (1). I have had difficulty finding a reference for how long the average vaccine takes, but out of all pharmaceuticals the average is 10.5 years (1). 

Now the majority of that time the leaders of these programs are fighting for funding, interest, good trial participation, and other hurdles. The covid-19 vaccine clearly did not have those hurdles. This is a disease that needs to be contained so funding is abundant, volunteers are everywhere, and the need is very evident. Money can solve a lot of problems, but it cannot make time move faster. mRNA vaccines are new, plain and simple. There has never been one like it to be mass produced and distributed like the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. 

Yes, there has been previous research on mRNA vaccines and their potential to protect against different viruses and diseases. So why is it that the covid-19 vaccines are the first mRNA vaccines to be produced? From my understanding, we do not have past trials to confirm the long term safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Based on our understanding of mRNA and the other components of the vaccine scientist believe that it is safe. That is a good reason to begin trials and carefully track the results and potential effects. I do not believe that is a reason to mass produce, speed through FDA approval, and even mandate the vaccine for participation in society. 

The FDA requires at least 2-months of safety data to approve Emergency Use Authorization for a vaccine (2). Pfizer and Moderna collected this data in their combined Phase I/II trials. The main concern here is that these vaccines has not been used before. We know what to expect with other types of vaccines such as subunit, live, and inactivated vaccines (3). I view this 2 months of safety data to be more applicable to more traditional vaccines because there is clear evidence that if there are severe adverse effects they will show themselves in the first 2 months. We do not know this to be true of mRNA vaccines. There is no history, there is no precedent to turn to. The mRNA vaccines are *probably* fine, but with the abundance of anecdotal reports of adverse reactions, an overflowing number of submission to VAERS, and the immense pressure that everyone is under to just get something passed through, I have a difficult time believe that everyone truly did their due diligence. On top of that, there is so much money involved in all of this. Money corrupts people. I believe the scientists and researchers are doing their best for society. I do not believe that the CEOs of Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, and the top government officials overlooking all of this are impartial. 

(I will fully admit that the end of my argument there moves away from the science and more towards politics, but I still think that it is a factor into why the vaccines have been approved so quickly.)

We also do not know much about the long lasting efficacy of the vaccine. Do two doses give life time immunity for the majority? We don’t know, shots haven’t been in arms long enough. But the number of breakthrough cases are rising so perhaps not. Side note, the CDC is no longer tracking all breakthrough cases. Only those that end in hospitalization and death. (4) I think that to know the true efficacy of these vaccines we need concrete numbers of the breakthrough cases and how severe they are compared to regular infections. And did you know that in the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials, they only counted cases as positive if they received a positive molecular test AND had at least one symptom? (5, pg14 and 6, pg15) So even if the vaccine reduces symptoms, how is it effective at preventing the spread if it does not stop a person from being infected? To me this suggests that we need to spend more time studying these vaccines.

I’m also concerned about how the vaccines effect the variants and future mutations. I might be totally off base here, but all I can think of is could it be similar to bacterial resistance. Could the amount of transmission between vaccinate people, regardless of how small, give rise to stronger and more resistant mutations? 

I will say though, that I agree the vaccine is the right choice for some people. The CFR for the elderly is extremely high and the vaccine clearly provides some sort of protection. I’m not against the vaccine altogether, I’m concerned that no one is considering the potential long term effects in younger people. At this point it should be available to those who want it but there is absolutely no reason for it to be mandated. 

Immediate Solutions:

This is a tough one. I spent a lot of today thinking about it because I do want to give a well thought out answer. 

I believe that personal responsibility is a big part of this. If you feel unsafe, take the precautions you deem necessary to stay safe. Isolate, social distance, masks, hand washing, all the things. You are not responsible for someone else’s actions. The government is not responsible for someone else’s actions. Each choice we make has associated risks, the same is true with covid. There are ways to gauge if you are likely to be exposed if you participate in an activity. Let people make their own choice on that.

I know a lot of people who don’t actually mind the masks or the social distancing but they are just unsure of the vaccine. Over time it’s built into resentment for only hearing about the pandemic and the vaccine. I think that if more information was available about what to do about covid that did not mention the vaccine, people would be more willing to listen. (I’m thinking like “how to treat covid at home” “what to do when a loved on has covid” “vitamins and minerals to help you stay healthy” “wash your hands”) I also think that the stigma and shame that is brought down on people who test positive adds to an overall negative view of the people who heavily promote the vaccines, which then influences how people think of the vaccine. 

Treatments. I think that there needs to be an equal focus on treatments for covid. People don’t want the vaccine yet? That’s okay, here’s how to treat if you catch it and here’s how to know when you need medical attention. I know that the doctors and nurses are exhausted, that’s why we need to spend more time on effective treatments that reduce a person’s chance in the hospital.

"Covid Vaccine Anxiety?
so let me preface this by saying i am not anti vax. thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s no case scenario when i wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t have gotten this vaccine. however i canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t help my anxiety over it!

i just had my first dose of the vaccine this week and while iÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m relieved, i canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t help but worry that i got a vaccine that was developed in under a year? does that worry anyone else? i trust the science completely but something in my brain also is telling me to worry.. any encouraging words?",0
"Covid Vaccine side-effects
Has anyone else experienced menstrual side-effects after having the covid vaccine? 

I had my first dose of Pfizer on Saturday and started bleeding on Sunday, I had missed my last period by almost two weeks and didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t have any symptoms of PMS prior. 

I spoke to a friend of mine who has PCOS (cysters!) and she also started bleeding one day after getting the vaccine. A quick google showed that some people have reported menstrual irregularities following injection.

"Getting the mRNA shot is an act of selfishness.
Fact: The ~~vaccine~~ gene therapy does not prevent transmission or infection, only symptoms. Here's Fauci admitting to [this](https://rumble.com/vevyw9-covid-vaccine-is-not-for-immunity.html) but it's not a hard to confirm fact.

So if you get the shot, you can still give to grandma.

So let's compare someone who has been turned into a GMO vs someone who didn't get the shot, if they both caught COVID.

GMO: Feels no symptoms, goes out and enjoys their day, has lunch with grandma, takes mask off to eat burrito, gets grandma sick, grandma dies, grandma wipes out her nursing home. People cry.

Unvaxxed: Feels symptoms so stays home, avoids others and quarantines. Cancels plans with grandma. Grandma and her nursing home cohorts lives to see another day.

Therefore:

GMOs - only benefit is to shot-taker, they get less sick but are more likely to pass it to others due to not experiencing symptoms. Benefit to self = 100% Benefit to humanity = 0%.

Unvaxxed: no benefit to self due to not getting the gene therapy. due to experiencing symptoms they can prevent others from catching the dreaded beer-flu. Benefit to self = 0% Benefit to humanity = 100%.

Remember this the next time someone wants to call you selfish because you want to experience symptoms and know when you're sick and infectious.

"Could the two Moderna COVID-19 vaccines be the triggers for my existential OCD?
I'm not talking about any fear of vaccines themselves. I mean something else:

A week after receiving the first vaccine (Moderna), intrusive and horrible thoughts were triggered after a whole school year of controlling them well. It took me two weeks to end this situation.

Two weeks after getting the second vaccine (also Moderna), thoughts have returned. After a few days, I still have them in my head.

I wonder if vaccines have something to do with this.",0
"Covid vaccine questions before taking the plunge
First off, I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but I currently have hesitations about taking it, mostly due to nobody knowing of any long term side effects. My belief is that it's gonna become another yearly flu vaccine. Say what you want but we're closing in on 2 years of this, it changes damn near monthly it seems with all the variants, and only showed signs of going away when we were on a strict mask mandate. And for some unknown reason before numbers hit zero, we dropped everything and in a months time, it was back worse than before.

However, my being diabetic(T1) still puts me at a higher risk, and nobody seems to want to wear a mask anymore, even though signs are posted everywhere. I don't want to be infected by some fucktard whining about wearing a mask and all that (I've wore a mask since the beginning and it puts me into a rage when all I hear is ""the unvaccinated are causing the spread""). If I'm gonna get sick, I want it to be due to my own stupidity. And having taken my gramma to the clinic for a simple follow up, there was like no parking. Hospitals are turning patients away because they're just at max capacity. At this point, I've been doing my considerations and I just feel like my risk of waiting to see long term side effects is just not worth it.

So anyways I'm scheduled to get the Pfizer today, if I get sick, I just want a better fighting chance, hopefully. I chose it because it's the same one my gf has taken and a few other friends. And I just want to get it while I still have a choice as to which one I take. The only complaints they reported was soreness at the injection site, which seems to be pretty common all around from what I've heard. But I don't know any other diabetics who've taken the vaccine, or anything they felt that I should be aware of. I've not had any issues with other vaccines I've taken, but like I said, this one is completely new and hasn't been around for decades to know.

So, did you take it? Which one? Anything I should be aware of such as sugar levels temporarily thrown around or whatever? Thanks for any input ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â˜Ã‚Â

EDIT:: Got my first dose yesterday. Went well, didn't feel a thing. Arm is a little sore this morning, but I think every vaccine I've taken has made my arm sore. ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â˜Ã‚Â Hoping my second has minimal side effects also.

 Thanks again everyone for your feedback!",0

"If ICU beds are low, why don’t they deploy hospital ships or tent hospitals?
I’m confused by the proportionality of infected people. Last year, when the virus was hospitalizing many more people than it is today in most of the US, tent hospitals were built and a hospital ship was deployed to NYC. I believe in the UK they also deployed similar “Nightingale” hospitals. These ended up being very light utilized. I don’t understand how at the height of the pandemic, these facilities were not needed, but now, when the Delta variant is sending fewer people to the hospital, ICU beds have run out. Can someone explain this? Why don’t they just deploy hospital ships or tent hospitals again? It can’t be cost because 1% of the 100 trillion they’re seemingly spending on pro-vax propaganda would pay for this. What do you all think?",-1

"Big law consensus around vaccine mandates
Last fall, as vaccines were about to be approved, my friend received a blizzard of emails from law firms that typically want his business.  They stated that vaccine mandates were legal, and employers could force employees to get jabbed.  He didn't mention much about this until just now that he received a flurry of emails again this week.  Like last fall, the laws firm, mostly NYC based, stated that vaccine mandates were legal.  My friend is the principal of a small private equity shop so he doesn't get direct access unless he wants to shell out money he doesn't want to spend.  However, Disney and Walmart just announced mandatory vaccines for some workers.  My guess is that this was due to consulting with various legal sources.  The implication of all this is that our elites have decided that mandatory vaccines are needed, and big law has coalesced around a consensus on this issue.  If big law is behind this, then it wouldn't be out of the question to say most of the legal system will fall in line.  In other words, don't anticipate of getting any legal relief.",-1

"Is it wrong to not feel bad for my unvaxxed family member that is really sick with COVID
A little backstory, my aunt and uncle are hardcore anti-vaxxers, very right wing Christians and raised all of their kids to be anti-vaccine to the point where all of my cousins' kids are homeschooled and unvaccinated for everything.

Two week ago, my aunt and uncle visited my (vaccinated) grandparents who are in their 80s, and my grandma has stage 4 cancer.  My grandparents recall my uncle sneezing and coughing and asked him about it and he claimed that it was just allergies. It was not, he tested positive for COVID about two days later, and my grandparents subsequently tested positive. Did he ever apologize for exposing them? Nope. Luckily my grandparents are now recovering and only had mild flu like symptoms but my uncle has been hospitalized for a week, experimental drugs did not work and will probably be on a ventilator soon. To make matters worse, my cousins are so deeply entrenched in the COVID is a hoax side that they have literally not posted a single post about my uncle being sick but still post anti-mask posts on facebook. I'm just having a hard time feeling sorry for him because his family have been very anti-mask and anti-vaxx as well as exposing my grandparents to COVID while the rest of the family have been very careful around them.

Update #1: He is currently on a ventilator and has been going downhill.

"â€œIâ€™ll say I told you so when youâ€™re in the ICUâ€ my brother is trying to push the vaccine on me
Out of the blue today, my brother texting my mother and I urging us to get the COVID jab. No idea why. When we spoke on the phone, he further elaborated his point by repeatedly saying â€œwhen youâ€™re in the ICU iâ€™ll just say I told you so.â€ My brother and his wife are fully vaccinated, as they were to convinced to get it by their work. But as my SIL phrased it, they did t exactly have a choice. So heâ€™s basically already been forced to get it and now heâ€™s trying the same with us. Same tactics vaccine passport proponents are saying, â€œwhen you canâ€™t travel, maybe youâ€™ll consider it.â€

Iâ€™ve been a lurking member here for a long time. I do not plan on getting the vaccine and I share information here with my mom to help strengthen her stance on not getting it. Simply too many vaccine related deaths for me to be comfortable with. 

My mom and I still mask, nothing crazy, just a fabric one with a filter though iâ€™ve slowly gotten more used to not wearing a mask in some places (gym, movie theatre, restaurants, etc). My mom and I have been in multiple airports both domestic and international during the pandemic. Weâ€™ve traveled, been to gatherings, and mask whenever we go to highly crowded places like the airport. Not one of us have fallen sick, even though Iâ€™m at higher risk for my age group (obese) yet I havenâ€™t gotten it once. My mother has been exposed no less than 5 times at her work, she hasnâ€™t fallen sick once. We have natural immunity at this point. We take the normal precautions of using masks... the vaccine is so pointless. 

Is there any hope once your family starts trying to convince you to get the vaxx? Every day I worry about my brother getting a potential side effect injury, even though when him getting the vaxx was entirely unwarranted. Heâ€™s young, active, a healthy male. His wife is the same, a young, active, healthy female. They never needed a jab for a virus they have a leg up on surviving. My father has tried the same with my mom, though my dad getting the jab makes more sense (obese, smoker, and he has several medical issues). 

At one time, because of my weight, I considered getting it. But the amount of vaccine injury reports and deaths Iâ€™ve seen on here, I donâ€™t want it. The lack of studies proving it worthwhile and effective, I donâ€™t want it. It being constantly pushed on me by the gov, by MSM, by my own family and by social media despite all the glaring issues, I donâ€™t want it.

"Template letter against vaccine passports/mandatory vaccines - please feel free to alter and send to your local/national politicians!
Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_ ,

I am deeply concerned by the discussion currently taking place in \_\_\_\_\_\_ to potentially mandate the COVID-19 vaccine in certain settings. Beyond the frightening implications such a decision could have on civil liberties, i.e., enforced medical discrimination, there are a number of valid reasons why some \_\_\_\_\_ians remain hesitant to take the COVID vaccine.

Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine are based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has never been approved for human use. Previous attempts at developing therapeutic drugs using this technology resulted in toxicity from repeat doses, which is particularly troubling given the active discussions on booster shots due to waning efficacy:

&gt;“Moderna had to pivot. If repeated doses of mRNA were too toxic to test in human beings, the company would have to rely on something that takes only one or two injections to show an effect.”  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“But when repeated doses of mRNA are needed to resupply a protein over a lifetime, side effects—potentially due to the buildup of lipid nanoparticles in the body or an inflammatory response to foreign RNA—loom larger.”  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/messenger-rna-gave-us-covid-19-vaccine-will-it-treat-diseases-too](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/messenger-rna-gave-us-covid-19-vaccine-will-it-treat-diseases-too)

Unlike most vaccines, which typically take 10-15 years to develop and test, the current set of COVID-19 vaccines have only undergone a few months of clinical trials and have no long term safety profile. Consequently, it is unknown whether antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or other autoimmune issues, which occurred in previous trials of coronavirus vaccines (e.g. SARS and MERS), could arise at a later time or with different, mutated strains of the virus.

The vaccine has already been linked with heart inflammation (myocarditis) in young adolescents/adults, with an incidence rate of up to 1 in 3000 according to one report submitted to the Israeli Ministry of Heath. This age group, in particular, has a significantly lower risk of developing severe reactions from the virus itself, with an infection fatality rate estimated to be less than 0.01%.

In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine and its ability to reduce transmission remains under question. In many countries with high percentages of their population fully vaccinated, including Iceland, Israel, and Malta, cases are markedly rising and the majority of hospitalized patients are now fully vaccinated. Gibraltar, in particular, has the highest vaccination rate in the world (greater than 99%) but is still currently undergoing its second highest wave in COVID-19 cases. New data from the Israeli Ministry of Health also suggests significantly lower efficacy over time:

&gt;“The Israeli statistics also appeared to paint a picture of protection that gets weaker as months pass after vaccination, due to fading immunity. People vaccinated in January were said to have just 16% protection against infection now, while in those vaccinated in April, effectiveness was at 75%.”  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-uk-data-offer-mixed-signals-on-vaccines-potency-against-delta-strain/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-uk-data-offer-mixed-signals-on-vaccines-potency-against-delta-strain/)

In this case, the burden of proof lies on the vaccine makers to prove the safety and efficacy of their vaccines. While many \_\_\_\_\_\_ians have taken the vaccine, others prefer to take a more cautious approach with a novel, experimental medication and should not be discriminated against based on this personal health decision. This is an absolutely fundamental, red line issue for many \_\_\_\_\_\_ians like myself – the freedom to decide what medical procedures I undergo without fear of discrimination or segregation.

"Safety of covid vaccine for breastfeeding?
My wife (29) is a teacher and received her first dose of Moderna in February. She is also nursing our 6mo daughter (which btw, requires so much strength and dedication to do while also being such a fantastic teacher!).

Right before her second dose, Providence Cancer Institute released a study on breast milk after covid vaccination, which basically found much-higher-than-expected levels of IgG (an immunoglobulin) in the milk, specifically after the second shot. It freaked her out because - even though IgG is a good thing for the baby - it indicated that they weren't REALLY sure what's actually in vaccinated breast milk.

She ended up cancelling her second jab, but wants to reschedule again when she's done a little more research.

There's lots of quotes online about how they're really sure breastfeeding is safe after vaccination, but none of them really present any evidence for that, besides a cursory ""we're sure nothing harmful ends up in the milk"" for the nonscientific population. We're not at all unwilling to trust health authorities, but especially with how political the vaccine has gotten we'd appreciate a scientific - we were both researchers at one point or another in our academic careers - explanation for how they are so sure, especially with this brand new immune tech.

Can anyone provide some insight into this, or point us to a source with actual research on the safeness of this technology (even something that came out before covid, but demonstrates an understanding about some of the vaccine's underpinning tech from prior research)?

Again, we're not unscientific, or anti-vax, we just want to hear it from research rather than a talking head.

Thanks!

"My experience with the virus and the vaccine. I learned a valuable lesson, take care of your body please read.
I have come here in hopes that my experience won’t get censored as this is the only place I feel I can be honest and not be patronized for sharing my real personal experience.

First I would like to share my experience with COVID. I’m 26F and normal weight, I got COVID 15 months ago and I was no where near dieing. I didn’t have a hard time breathing I didn’t even cough, but I can’t say it didn’t fuck me up on other ways. For 8 months I couldn’t exercise it was like I had chronic fatigue but I started feeling better after 8 months. 15 months later I STILL can’t taste food which I must say has been very depressing and I let myself drop to a very low weight because eating is a chore now…. I absolutely hate this virus for robbing me of my taste for so long….But none of this warrants forced lockdowns or vaccination and the truth is that what I experienced may be rare. Do you want to know why I had these really problems with COVID? Because I DONT take care of myself and it caught up.

Well here comes the part that gets me censored left and right, doctors tell me I’m stressed and I’m not. I’m having side effects from the vaccine. Now I have been a skeptic of the vaccine for some time but when I met people that said their taste came back because of it I decided to take the risk and take it in hopes my taste came back. On top of that I had family pressure to take it anyways. Well not only did it now come back yet I started having some bad side effects. To the point where I never ever want to take another vaccine or “booster” (lol) again.

My side effects from Pfizer:

1.Chest paint
2. Heart skipping beats
3.Tightness in chest
4.Shortness of breathe
5. Kidney levels came out weird in bloodwork and they hurt
6. My period is now irregular and I’m having hormone irregularities, my boobs hurt nonstop for months with intermittent bleeding

The moral of my story is for the love of God take care of yourself, COVID wouldn’t have done damage to me like that if I just would have taken care of myself and not eat junk all the time. And stand your fucking grounding you don’t want the vaccine don’t take it, I’m living proof that the vaccine can cause harm. And fuck lockdowns keep fighting! Please just eat good and exercise and take vitamins. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

Edit: my boobs aren’t bleeding, they just hurt and I have intermittent bleeding from my lady parts as well",-1
"Very sore arm 2 months after having COVID vaccine
So I had my first COVID vaccine (moderna) 2 months ago and this morning when I woke up I had an achy pain right where I had my jab but I just thought IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d slept weird on my arm. As the day goes by the pain is getting so much worse to the point where I canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t even lift my arm up, it feels like IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve just had the jab again. I was just wondering if anyone can relate or knows why this is happening?",0
"CanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t sleep after 1st COVID shot, anyone else?
I got the shot yesterday morning came home had a 3 hour nap cause I woke up early to go get it. was laying in bed for hours trying to fall asleep this morning but only slept for 3 hours. So in 30 hours IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve slept 3 hours but I feel great and wide awake, which isextremely weird for me. I have a pretty consistent sleep schedule (sleep at 2/3 wake up at 11/12) and usually I need about 9 hours of sleep to wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day, so for me to have that little amount of sleep is crazy.

feeling a little odd about this seeing as I feel no tiredness at all and am wide awake so was just wandering if anyone else had something similar",0
"Pfizer Covid vaccine yesterday, my experience so far
I received the covid vaccine yesterday around noon ET. The clinic I went to was using the Pfizer vaccine. The best part of the experience was having the people checking me in and the nurse administering the shot asking me how I was able to get the vaccine when I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t look 60 and donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t work in healthcare or childcare (IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m 39 M) and I just pulled out my pump to show them. In my state, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s now 60 or older unless you have other qualifying medical conditions. 

I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t experience any side effects until around 4pm, and then they were mild, just some aches and pains in my joints. Tylenol took care of those. 

Last night and most of today my BG has been running higher than normal, which I chalk up to my body reacting to the vaccine. Nothing horrible, like 180-200. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m usually around 120. 

Other than that, no ill effects.",1
"How to avoid the inevitable ""Have you gotten your vaccine yet?""
Like many of you, I am abstaining on getting the vaccine, for several reasons. I am healthy, in my early 30's, average BMI, with no major (or minor) underlying health conditions. I live an active lifestyle, I work outside 5 days a week, and supplement a multi-vitamin, zinc, and fish oil daily.

I've had a discussion with my Doctor, and he agrees that it is more than reasonable to abstain for someone in my demographic, as he says ""COVID does not pose a serious health risk"" to me. He also supported my decision to not get vaccinated against COVID.

The problem is, I am surrounded by friends and family (mostly my age or younger) who are super excited about the fact that they've been vaccinated, spamming Instagram with their virtuous vaccine card selfies. This is how the conversation usually goes:

""When are you getting your vaccine?""

""I'm not.""

""Why?""

I inevitably explain that it's none of their business, but these intellectual titans immediately jump to labeling me as ""anti-vax"" and ""anti-mask"".

There is no nuance to this conversation. I am fully vaccinated against everything that has an FDA approved vaccine. If I had a child tomorrow, they would get the full battery of vaccines. But somehow, any resistance to getting inoculated with something that was rushed to market in &lt; 9 months is an egregious crime against humanity. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how do I tactfully and respectfully avoid these stupid fucking conversations?",-1
"Covid Vaccine ??
Has anyone had any luck in crossing state lines, in order to receive a Covid vaccine? I have been able to secure an appointment for both my Mother and myself for tomorrow in NY.  We are willing to take the 3 hour drive; however, now, I am concerned about possibly being turned away. 

FYI: Both my Mother and I are eligible to receive the vaccine, yet are having a significant difficult time in securing an appointment in Southern NJ. 

Thank you for any feedback.",1
"Family full of anti-vaxxers now know I am COVID-19 vaccinated
I (f 22) need advice on how to proceed with an open conversation with my anti-vax grandparents. I currently live with them.

I told myself that I would not tell them about my vaccination unless they specifically mentioned it or asked me my thoughts on it. I thought I was prepared for an open conversation about it, but it turns out I was not.

I am currently unemployed and looking for a position. After discussing my current plans for my next steps, my grandma mentioned to me ""Hey! You had COVID a while back right? Don't forget to tell your potential employers that you are immune.""

I hesitated for a moment before saying, ""Well, actually, I'm in the process of getting the vaccine. I had the first one and am getting the second one shortly.""

G: ""Why would you get it if you've already had COVID?""

I explained that the CDC guidelines still recommend it for those who have had it. She looked over at my grandpa and that was the end of discussion. I tried to discuss my symptoms when I had COVID, but they just didn't seem interested in the conversation anymore.

 I'm not sure if they are mad at me or if they are scared for me. A while ago, they mentioned they were super nervous about the side effects and praying for those who received the shots.

Any advice for how to either try to convince them that this was the best decision for me? They have a habit of believing far right conspiracy theories, and I'm just uncertain how to alleviate their fears.

Thank you. I appreciate all avenues of advice.",1
"Your immune system only has so much strength, so much resources, that it can put into being prepared for different possible attacks. When you take a vaccine, you are weakening yourself against most other things in exchange for increased defense against a specific attack.
Since I have not experienced such an attack in the 1.5 years I've been hearing about it, but I have been constantly attacked by the usual bacteria etc around me, I am not convinced I should divert my immune resources away from what is keeping me healthy against the usual stuff around me and put it into this thing that has not yet attacked me. Plus there could be other unknown effects of a vaccine, but even if its the greatest vaccine with no side effects, there is still that cost. Why should I make myself weaker against, for example, the bacteria found in beef chicken and pork, so that I'd be more likely to catch worms from eating pork, in exchange for increased defense against covid?",-1
"Double Feature: I hate that people continue to spread misinformation about COVID 19 in general and how me acting in good faith to fix an error with my posts title from yesterday led to assumptions of me being a anti-vaxxer when I am not.
Originally I posted this yesterday, and had a typo in the title which I have fixed, but we will get to that later.

**tl;dr I am pro-vax and for people getting vaccinated. COVID-19 Misinformation and Disinformation is what is killing the world and society.**

Why? Why do people still continue to believe in lies and not the actual reality? Why do they care more about their feelings and false reality instead of listening to the facts from professionals? Do they realize that it's like most diseases that are real? Why do they disregard this one in particular as a ""fake"" or ""bio-weapon""? Why do they hate to look at the other side that debunks everything they say? Why after all these days of the pandemic, still don't care about it at all? Why are they so hell bent on human rights when they know human rights need to be modified in cases of a worldwide crisis? Why?

COVID is real, the vaccine works, everything about it has been backed up for eons since this god damn pandemic started.

They were given every opportunity to listen to the WHO and CDC and other related government health groups. However they disregard that because they were ""corrupted"" by oh no ""FORIEGN DEEP STATE INTERESTS LOL"". If they were does that deny what they researched is true? Every single report about everything has been proven to debunk your crazy ass theories, but after all that, you still cling on to your false disinformation.

This pandemic has been a worldwide effort, every single god damn country helped to fight the virus. You cared more about disregarding actual truths because of that for your own corrupted version of freedom.

I'm sorry but they are the ones who will end the world and end the value of civility in democracy and civil discourse in the world.They are the same people that tried to end America because they lost, tried to ban an app to eliminate the First Amendment of Free Speech (TikTok) that the CIA and other top researchers of the world proved it's harmless because they can't handle the criticisms of their president thanks to TikTok's userbase and 4chan cooperating in on it, are hypocrites by supporting police that fits their agenda because oh no when the capitol police served justice to the terrorists back in January they decry that, and tried to eliminate history and the actual reality by making up some bullshit boogyman called CRT to suppress the truth we taught to our kids for decades.

They also cared more about some stupid Twitch PogChamp emote being banned to downplay the January 6th terrorist attack all over Twitter.And they have the g'all to be called pro-lifers? Laughable, didn't realize that not getting a shot to cure humanity is equal to providing life. It's almost as if they are pro-death or anti-life... or maybe pro-choice... but they hate that... hmmmmm.

I have an idea that these PSA people do which is run PSAs about disinformation and eliminate it. I don't fucking care if this idea is good and bad, we should stop sitting back on our asses and fight back hard. Yes they are fucking crazy, but what are we doing just accepting it?

Can't we just do something, say no, take them to a licensed professional and have them open their god damn eyes for one second, or maybe just maybe create lies catered to them so we can take advantage and make them get the shot through our lie game?

\--------

Now as of this, I have gotten unbanned because my old post had a typo in it, The original title was: ""Why do people still believe in COVID and in general disinformation after everything that has happened in the past year and now?"" Which has the same text with differences. Because of this confusion I got perma'd and then changed to a one day ban to rectify the issue.

I admit it was early in the morning yesterday and I fucked up. The title sounded like I was anti-vax but the body of the post says otherwise. I was rushing to go to work to get something out. I apologize on that front on behalf of the people that saw this yesterday.

[They know the confusion and I explained it to them but they character assassinated me and called me a plague rat. I literally just now reposted the same rant into their mailbox because I'm pissed now. I'm FOR the vaccination. How did they think when I said ""I was talking about lies about covid"" they mean HUR DUR ANTI-VAX BS.](https://imgur.com/a/CxnSysR) I am literally pro vax, my rant was pro vax shit that EVERYONE NEEDS TO HEAR ON THIS GOD DAMN EARTH. I believe everyone should get the shot to save humanity and the world! It's what we ALL want. But no, HUR DUR YOUR PLAGUE RAT.

If it's my wording, look I apologize, it was heated could've reworded it differently, but the rant was so blatantly obvious and the way I explained it in the mailbox is SO SIMPLE.

\&gt;Why do people still believe ***in lies about COVID*** and spreading disinformation about it general I'm sick of it. That's the post.

""***in lies about COVID"".*** COVID Misinformation being spread.

""***in lies about COVID"".*** Cure being horse paste and the ""survival rates"".

""\*\*\*in lies about COVID"".  ""\*\*\*HUR DUR BIOWEAPON"".

Do you see where I am fucking getting at?

Look at my profile, I supported the elimination of disinformation on reddit in regards to NNN and general COVID misinformation. Can they not ""do their research""? Motherfucker dude.

I am ashamed of the team for this.

Not to mention I deleted the post because apparently it was raided by one anti-vaxxer who artificially flooded the comments and I wanted to clear the air because shit like that KILLS, but if they say that's admission of guilt, I don't know what the fuck to say now except no it fucking doesn't. Fun fact: Viewing a persons post and comment history exists! I posted the same rant with the same wording on another sub and one glance says I am fucking pro-vax and hate disinformation in general.I care, and I don't want misinformation to spread by this one commenter on that post, I just wish they hear me out.

Holy shit COVID is real, everyone should get the vax, and we should eliminate disinformation, but from that typo and my actions in good faith you assume I'm an anti-vaxxer? Fuck you. That's what gets people to leave from a sub with a good purpose.

P.S. and guys, if you ban me for this critique. It says a lot about you are willing to assume and character assassinate over the truth. I'm sorry for this, but DO BETTER.  


P.S.S. Removed any mention of the word because oh no I am ""witch-hunting"" when this is actual criticism in the second part!",1

"It’s the guilt tripping for me
I finally stood up to my family (again) after their new and improved harassment over delta/lambda bullshit. Sent all the clinicaltrials.gov trial completion dates/links after being gaslit and told it was proven safe for pregnancy. Bullshit it has. Pfizer literally states that there is insufficient data to inform vaccine associated risks in pregnancy, and that there is no data to assess the effects of the vaccine on breastfed infants or on milk production. Oh- and that the vaccine may not protect all recipients and that there are severe adverse reactions (they don’t list any besides anaphylaxis and refer you to VAERS). I have been indirectly threatened and I called the bluff. Demanded they no longer speak to me about it and that I would not be attempting to explain my decision anymore as I have already tried. The guilt tripping starts and indirect ridiculing. I started sobbing because it feels like I’ve lost my family in some sense. They are disappointed and it hurts so much. I feel like shit. I can’t believe our loved ones are willing to take it this far. The alienation is really taking a toll on me.

"Several Vaccinated People I’ve Been Around Have Gotten COVID. I didn’t get the vax and I’m still fine.
Isn’t that ironic?

I have felt just fine besides a few allergies. Last week apparently a member of my job got COVID as well as her family. I’m the only one in the office not vaccinated… perfectly fine. For context I’m mid 20s, great health - very active and I hike almost every weekend. I’m not overweight and am at just about the perfect weight for my height.

My mom has become a Covid Conspiracy theorist. She got into a private Facebook group last Summer and since then has gone completely irrational. My biggest concerns are she is creating an envionrment that is not ok to be around. She constantly brings up these bizzare theories about how the Vaccine can mess up your DNA. I'm not kidding she told me a few weeks ago that my random bruising could be because I am shedding. Those who arent vaccinated can be affected by it. I never rolled my eyes so hard. She tells my siblings and I not to get vaccinated and that she regrets it. The first thing she says whenever an exposure happens is ""Oh im vaccinated I should be fine"".

"Got my first COVID Vaccine Dose Yesterday (Pfizer)
Hey guys.

Yesterday I had my first vaccine dose at a FEMA Vaccination Center.

After being on my clinicÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s waitlist, I woke up on Friday saying to myself ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœI gotta get vaccinated todayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. So I decided to advocate for myself and started to call my clinic back and forth, while I also contacted every vaccination center around my area.

Finally, I found out that only with a Vulnerability Form signed by my physician, I could go straight up to the FEMA Vaccination center. No appointments, no nothing. Just walk up there and show my forms.

I sent the form to my clinic, and even when I live an hour apart (not a big deal either), I said that if they could have it signed the same day, I would be there ASAP and I would get vaccinated right away.

After an hour or so, they sent me an email telling me I could go there to get my form. I jumped in my car, I got my form, I went straight to the FEMA center and after 45 min I was in my car back to my house.

They were very efficient and helpful. I asked which vaccine they were administering and the lady said ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœI got you on Pfizer thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s fineÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â (my doctor is still not too sure about J&amp;J so thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s why I asked)

In summary, no reactions, no delays (just the clinic waitlist), and great service. I appreciate the job all these volunteers and FEMA staff are doing. CanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t thank them enough.

I encourage you to advocate for yourself (if you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t done so) and see how Can you get vaccinated in your state. My experience was in FL; in some states is easier to get it so if you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t been able to get yours, and you want to get it done soon, just make a few calls and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m sure youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll have your first shot after a couple of days, if not the same day.

Take care!

PS: I repeatedly mentioned that it was a FEMA center because some other centers require appointments. They told me that you donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t need appointments for the federal vaccination sites; so if you contact other places they may require an appointment.",1
"Is honest conversation even possible anymore?
Hey folks, I just discovered this community yesterday. I don't normally post and although my account is not that new, I have been on Reddit since around 2010. I have seen different things happen here where public discourse has been both positive and absolutely toxic. I experienced this yesterday.

Years ago, I remember when people were outraged that certain businesses were starting to make healthcare decisions for their employees by preventing them from getting certain medicines through their company provided insurance. The outrage was palpable. I was part of the outrage.

A lot has changed since then. I have become a significantly less triggered person and have come to accept others' opinions, even if I don't agree with them. I don't have the need to tell someone they are wrong. They have the right to be wrong and I respect that.

I am starting to get seriously concerned about the state of discourse online. The internet is becoming an echo chamber of angry people with half-baked opinions who are unwilling to tolerate an opinion that is different from theirs.

Full disclosure, I've had COVID. My father had COVID. My grandfather died of COVID. My other grandmother had COVID too, but she is still alive and doing well. I understand that we have to take certain precautions, but you cannot take away people's freedoms just because they might get sick for a little while. Now you cannot even question the narrative of the media or you're labeled as a crazy person. 

I'm not anti-vaccine because I go with the science. That being said, I am very grateful for all of the medicines that are available to us to treat all sorts of diseases. But I'm not for forcing medicines on anyone, anymore than I am for withholding medicines. Are we really at the point where we are willing to squash the right of others in the name of giving us back  our freedoms? 

I've seen this movie before when I was 15 years old in 2001. We voluntarily gave the US government the unilateral ability to spy on us in the name of National Security. People want to know what freedoms are being taken away from us now. I'll give you a hint, if you get vaccinated you can go places again, ie: you can have your freedoms back.

I don't know what to do, but I refuse to engage with everyone in the same toxic manner that I was treated in the other subreddit. Please remember that you're dealing with other human beings. When they lash out, they're doing it from a place of fear. Meet them with kindness. Just as them lashing out will not change your mind, they will not respond positively if you lash back. Bring them to your level by asking them questions to clarify their position. Do not tell them they are wrong.  Either you will learn something from them, they will change their opinion, or you will begin building a conversation and cultivate respect between each other.

We will get through this with kindness, not with hate and insults.",0
"Depersonalization after covid vaccine?!?
Its been 2 days now since I had my first jab of sinopharm vaccine for covid.

After 4 hrs i couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t handle the pain anymore and took an ibuprofen 400.  didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t help me at all but my paracetamol (guess itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Tylenol In the USA) was too old. My boyfriend got a new one from the pharmacy. Took a paracetamol 500 in the evening which helped my headache a little. Went to bed with another hot water bottle still feeling terrible. Woke up freezing and twice sweating the night every hour. 

Today is day 2: my headache is still there but not feverish or freezing (was in the morning but went away). I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to take another pain killer so I put mint oil on my forehead which usually helps against headache very good if itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not too strong. It helps but headache is still there. I try without pain killers. 

Arm hurts really bad and lymph nodes in the left armpit are huge swollen (never had this before. Also not after shot 1). Lymph nodes around my throat are even bigger (I posted here few days ago). 

I suffered from covid arm starting 8 Days after the first shot. Red, swollen, itchy. Went away after 4 weeks. 
Now the injection spot from shot 2 (a little above shot 1) is red but the rash and warmth and swelling below where my first shot was is back!!

Did anyone else face this? I thought it was gone completely. This is very weird. 

So, still feeling not able to do anything and sick but I believe itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s getting better and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m glad I will now have the best protection in 2 weeks that was possible for me.",0

"Covid vaccine and Herpes
I remember when I got my Pfizer vaccine something very strange happened in my usual herpes outbreak areas. It was a mini outbreak that didn't last long and wasn't as painful. It came quick, they scabbed over quick, and were much smaller.

Tbh, its only painful for about 3-5 days, but obviously my wife and I refrain from sex for about 2 weeks. So far, I have not passed it on to her, and I have had herpes for about 3-4 years now.

"Detailed Description of Javits Center Process for Covid Vaccination.
I just got the Pfizer shot at Javits Center and thought I'd share what the process looks like so everyone knows what to expect.  In sum, the entire process should take about 30 minutes:

* (1) You enter at the corner of 11th Avenue and 36th Street.

* (2) Upon entrance, they will ask you to provide (a) copy of your ID, and (b) copy/picture of your appointment confirmation.  Processing time will take 0-30 seconds.

* (3) You are then directed to the main convention hall of the Javits Center, following a circuit of colored stripes from one location to the next.  Walking time will take 30-60 seconds.

* (4) The second check in point will place you sitting down opposite an admin type person.  Here they will ask for your ID again, as well as a copy/picture of your appointment confirmation.  The admin person will also ask you a series of question relating to your health and whether you've had any recent symptoms.  If they ask you to provide proof of your co-morbidity, they will ask here - from four friends I can say none were asked to reveal their co-morbidity.  Processing time here will take about 3-5 minutes.

* (5) You will then be directed to another section of the conference hall where you will again be seated, and again you will follow the painted stripes on the floor to your next location.  Walking time of 30 seconds.

* (6) You are now in the ""health"" section where the nurses are.  You will sit down and hand your ID to an admin person who is with the nurse.  You will wait for a vaccine to be brought to your location (can take less than one minute, but can take several minutes if they are changing out vats of vaccines ... for me, I was unfortunate and the waiting time was 15 minutes for a vaccine to be brought to us).  The nurse will then administer the shot, and the admin person will give you a vaccine card that includes a sticker from the vaccine shot as well as the date for the next appointment that will take place three weeks later - keep this vaccine card for your records.  Process should take between 5-10 minutes (but in my unlucky case it took 30 minutes). 

* (7) You are then directed to a seating area that is immediately adjacent to the health section.  You are asked to sit here for a full 15 minutes to see if there are any adverse effects before leaving.  It's a little awkward as the seating area is just rows upon rows of individual chairs separated 6 feet apart.  I skipped this part of the process, but through slight .. not sure if you're ""allowed"" to per se.

Overall I was highly impressed with how smooth the process was.  One other thing to note is that you can go with someone and walk through the entire process together.  Nice for couples who schedule the appointment together.",1

"Hypothetical future
Let's imagine for a moment that Charles Hoffe's warning is true (60% of vaccinated will be dead within 3 years): what do you think would happen to societies in this scenario?

At one point, the deaths will be too many to be faked (covid variants or something else), also because people will eventually notice that only vaccinated are dying.
What would happen then to all those politicians and media who pushed for the vaccination? There will be more than 1 billion deaths in the world, I don't think people would accept a democratic confrontation with the responsibles, especially the vaccinated: what would they have to lose after all? They'd probably drag them out their homes .Also, will the vaccine producers be dragged in front of a new Nuremberg tribunal or will the penal shield be still valid?

However, the vaccinated would be walking deads, they wouldn't be allowed to drive a vehicle for example, for the risk of dying at the wheel while on a highway.
Also, that would make all countries with high vaccination rates extremely exposed to enemies: in three years, military forced would be halved, at best.
For the unvaccinated it wouldn't be a victory tho: beside losing beloved people who decided to get the shot, a sudden halving of population is a societal collapse. Virtually the majority of medics would be dead. Transporters, Employers, Technicians (for example for running a nuclear plant) and so on.

I think that Hoffe might have been sensationalistic and what he says likely won't happen, this scenario is more like a discussion for sci-fi fans.. a ""what if"" universe.",-1

"TIFU by not listening to the doctor when getting my COVID vaccine
Obligatory this didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t happen today but rather over the course of this past week. 

I was finally eligible to get my Covid vaccine here in Germany, so on Tuesday i went to the vaccination centre to get vaccinated. I had a big project due on Friday and I had to wait a bit to get my vaccine, so I was really anxious because I wanted to get back to my project ASAP. When I went into the booth, there was a doctor who explained everything to me, but I thought ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœitÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s just a vaccine, what could happen apart from a bit of pain and maybe a headache?ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â And didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t really pay attention. So I got my vaccine, went back home and continued to work on my project. On Wednesday, I had blood drawn and I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t mention I had gotten my vaccine the day before, because why would I? So I again went back home and worked on the project until late in the night. Thursday and Friday were also spent working on the project with no break. I finished it in time, it turned out great, I was really happy.

 Cut to today. I wake up and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m feeling like shit. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m super nauseous, my head feels like itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s gonna explode, really dizzy and I feel like I was run over by a freight train. I basically slept the entire day. 
Turns out that one of the things the doctor said was ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœplease take a break and rest for a bit to let your body accept the vaccineÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, which I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t hear and therefore didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t do. Luckily, there is a bank holiday on Monday so IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll be able to rest for two days.

TL;DR: got my Covid vaccine, didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t listen to the doctor who told me to rest and take it easy, spent the whole week working on an important project with no break and my body got revenge by making me feel like death warmed up today. Listen to your doctor, guys!",0

44/F/5'2""/150lbs

I am in Canada. I took my first dose of Astra Zeneca vaccine 2 weeks ago. My arm has hurt - not sore but a sharp pain in the area for the last 2 weeks. I can barely lift my arm and cannot lift anything with it. It hurts to even type and I have taken ibuprofen 800mg twice a day to just make it through the day. I don't think I have other symptoms but the ibuprofen could be negating them. I have had tendonitis in that shoulder and the shot was kinda close to that area and has intensified the pain in my shoulder. Yesterday an itchy rash has developed on the spot where I got the shot.

I was told by my doctor that this was normal. Everyone I know was fine in a day or two and this has been going on 2 weeks.

Generally I have been in good health. I was diagnosed as diabetic but lost 25 lbs and cut out all carbs and sugar and my blood levels are normal now. I have not been sick in the last 7 years. I did not get flu shots during that time. The last year I got the flu shot was the last time I was sick.

I am taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg and  Almodipine 10mg for my high blood pressure Synthroid 75mcg for my hypothyroidism both of which are under control with medication.

"Arkansas Employer Mandates
So I wanted to share some stuff that has been happening in the State of Arkansas. I was born here and have lived here most of my life. My son was also born here. I work as a financial analyst for a utility company.

Both Tyson and Walmart (both huge in Arkansas, especially Walmart) have mandated vaccination for their employees, as have many hospitals, which I am vehemently against. I don't believe that is an employer's business, and believe that is coercion and removes medical informed consent from an individual. There has been push back, and I found that a State senator filed a bill on 8-5 that would make it illegal for employers to ask vaccination status or discriminate based on vaccination status.

The AR Senate was supposed to take it up a few days ago, and did not. It seemed like it was dead for at least 2 months. However, yesterday, a joint House and Senate hearing of the judiciary committee heard testimony from employer reps, employees, doctors, legal experts, and those who have been harmed by vaccines in the past. 

It was voted to move forward in committee and they are trying to get reps to sign on to bringing the legislature back in session to debate it. I'm keeping a close eye on this, and I felt there were many reps that were on board. You can tell that they have been getting lots of calls. One rep told the Tyson rep, ""a lot of your employees have been calling me, worried they are going to lose their jobs.""

I personally feel that the case was better made for passing the law to ban employer mandates than the employers made the case for why they are doing it. 

A doctor who testified stated that every drug, vaccine or procedure offered needs to allow for informed consent, and that the patient needs to hear the pros and cons before partaking in that treatment, and that isn't happening here. He was not opposed to the covid vaccine, but didn't see why healthy teens would need it.

It gives me hope though that this madness will be stopped in my state at least. Hopefully. Our governor is terrible, has been pushing vaccines like crazy, and even regrets lifting his own mask mandate (the legislature basically forced him to), so I can see him vetoing it if it passes, but then again, if it has enough support from the people, he'll sign it, or they'll override his veto. They did that recently with a trans kids law that got lots of attention, including on Tucker Carlson's show.

Anyway, sorry for the long rant, but I think these employer's mandates are terrible for employees, especially low skilled and poorer individuals and amount to coercion. I can post a link to the entire committee meeting if anyone wants to watch it. It was really fascinating, and gave me hope for some sanity in my state.",-1

We have three vaccines! And there is an anti vaxxer army! What is it?!? Is it a problem of choice? Some people accuse our government of mandatory vaccinations. Do you know how it looks inside?

\-People, please, get a vaccine, - the government says, - We have for you ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœSputnik VÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. We studied it. Scientists in other countries studied it too. It is safe and effective. 

\-No! - the crowd tells - We donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t trust in ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœSputnik VÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â!

\-WellÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦ - the government says, - We also have for you two other vaccines. What do you prefer?

\-It is a conspiracy! - the crowd yells. 

\-People! We try to save your lives! If you insist, we should obligate you to be vaccinated. Or we will not allow you to work and visit restaurants!.. 

And it works in some cases. However, many people still are avoiding vaccination. 

More over! There are crowds without masks in public transport! It annoys me. They sit near to you, cough, speak by phoneÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦ I never ask them but I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t doubt that these people donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get the vaccine.

She told me that I was right, and she probably should have got the vaccine looking back on it.  Part of her still thinks that I may have side effects down the road, but this is progress!

"Malar rashes after covid vaccine
I got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine a few weeks ago, and I got a malar rash about 6 hours later. I otherwise had minimal side effects, and it did not trigger an actual flare. I have been feeling quite well in the past few weeks.

I have had only about five malar rashes in the eight years I have been diagnosed with Mixed connective tissue disease/lupus. I thought this could be a coincidence, but a few hours after my second dose this morning, I developed another malar rash! Has anyone else heard of this?

Update: I didn't have any severe side effects. I kind of felt like I had a cold but without respiratory symptoms (basically I felt weak and fatigued but not in an autoimmune way, and my temperature increased a bit) for about 32 hours.

Also wanted to note that the malar rashes' appearance and duration were typical for me.",1

"Get your Covid-19 vaccines!!!
Story time.

As I got out of the house headed for work, I was bewildered by two men on their motorcycles. This Guy A was about to go to the vaccine center to get his shot, but Guy B loudly broadcasted (they were in front of our gate) that the vaccine is ""more dangerous"" than the virus itself (hahaha okay). That Guy B watched a Facebook video of an ""expert"" claiming that Covid-19 vaccines cause more harm than prevention (duh, you can be completely vaccinated and still get the virus, but it won't be severe).

It probably took Guy A a lot of courage to finally decide on getting the shot, but some idiot was literally on his face telling him not to and so he got conflicted. My dad and I for a moment interrupted the two men (since I was going to work and I don't wanna be late; I'm never late), so we told Guy A to be on his way to the vaccine center and if I just had more time, I would've definitely argued with Guy B.

Now I'm at work and I looked up the video Guy B was talking about, and it's probably this endocrinologist, Dr. Dolores Octaviano. Her claims were fact-checked and proven to be false. So please guys, don't be gullible and believe what you've heard or seen. Do further research.

And if you're scared and uncertain of the vaccine, be it. Just don't go around harassing people and rubbing in your beliefs. I just really hope Guy A got vaxxed.

"Reaching out
Hello everyone!

I am making this post to try and understand.

I am very much in the pro-vaccine bubble, but with people in my family voicing concerns. 

I understand the reserves that many, in my family and in this sub, have expressed concerning the vaccine, especially concerning how quickly it was ready, and how obviously it is being pushed (full propaganda that's for sure). 

But I am trying to think from a state manegement point of view : how to avoid loosing an important proportion of your population to a pandemic, and how to reduce as much as possible the economic falldown, that we are likely to feel for many years to come?

It sounds to me like the vaccine is the best shot (no pun intended), not as the best solution, or safest, but as the least worst solution, after balancing out the advantages and risks of that choice.

This is my current reflexion. Let me know what you think, I am curious of hearing an opinion that is not fundamentally full anti-vax.",1

"""COVID Arm"", Anyone?
I received my first dose of Moderna at an HRM pharmacy within the past two weeks. I developed a large red rash near my injection site nine days post vaccine. I did not have any rash prior to day nine. Everything is consistent with what I can find online about ""COVID/Moderna Arm"".

Many articles say this delayed hypersensitivity is ""uncommon"" or ""rare"", but I find it hard to believe that it is so unusual.

Did you experience this side effect? If you did, did you report it? How do you report it?

Edit: I did have some side effects immediately post vax. I had chills (no fever) for 24 hours, general mild malaise for 24 hours, and a sore arm for 48 hours. I was symptom free between 48 hours and when the rash showed up.

Edit 2: Added photo for others to compare their rash to.

Note: I am aware of cellulitis, this is not cellulitis. I've drawn a line (not growing), it isn't warm, I do not have a fever, etc.

"The Fallacy of Exclusivity- Alternative Treatments for COVID-19
Pharma companies would love you to believe that their vaccine is the one and only treatment for COVID &amp; that natural immunity + other remedies are not effective or neccessary

Of course theyd like you to believe this since just two pharma companies, Moderna &amp; Pfizer, in just one year, 2021, off just one of their products, their COVID vax, are expected to make $32+ billion 

In order to provide EUA status to vaccines, there can be no other viable, available treatments for COVID


Natural Immunity: 

First and foremost your immune system is the best weapon against any virus. You need to lead healthy lifestyles in order to empower it. You have to eat and drink healthy, get fresh air and exercise (The latter two have been effectively blocked by curfews, stay at home orders and lockdowns). 

Natural immunity is highly effective and according to some studies can last years. Do not let the pharma connected WHO or anyone else have you second guess your natural immunity. 

Your chance of survival from COVID is 99.97%. There are other killers out there that we are all used to which kill more than COVID ever will. 

A list of Alternative Remedies for COVID + other viruses (Some have been suppressed to uplift the vax): 


2. Hydroxichloroquine with Zinc 

3. Ivermectin 

4. High dose Vit D and/or Vit D tablets 

5. High dose Vit C and/or Vit C tablets 

6. Zinc Tablets 

7. Asprin 

8. Look up the iMASK and MATH+ protocols- remedies for COVID 

9. Herbal teas including green tea, mint tea &amp; teas rich in Vit C, Zinc, etc 

10. Gingko Biloba- boil water &amp; put one teaspoon of dried or fresh leaves in it for 5-7 mins, filter out and drink with or without honey 

11. Natural, at home remedies can also help. These include steaming for colds with or without vicks, hot beverages with honey, ginger and/or lemon (organic), etc 

12. Drink a hot beverage called Samahan. Mix one pack of it with hot water and drink at least once a day. You can usually buy this at Indian stores. 

Specific hot beverage recipe that can help:  

Black pepper- powder, 
Ginger- break it down with mortar/pestel, 
Boil above in water &amp; add lemon

Having the above mentioned hot beverages/teas on a regular basis whether you're feeling unwell or not is a good habit to uptake &amp; a good preventive measure. They are all natural ingredients.

"COVID misinformation killed one of my patients yesterday
I work in emergency medicine at a local hospital.  Yesterday we had a 45 yo male patient brought in by the paramedics in full cardiac arrest.  The brief info we got from the paramedic crew was that the patient had no known medical history outside of recently being diagnosed with COVID and had been trying to recover at home. He'd had a sudden episode of difficulty breathing and his wife called 911.  He went in to cardiac arrest in the ambulance.  We worked him in the ER for 30 minutes but couldn't get him back.  

So as I'm looking at his chart, I realize I know the patient, or rather I know his wife (we went to high school together).  I went to the family privacy room to offer my condolences. It was during our talk that she gave me more of the background.  She said her husband thought COVID was overhyped and been outspoken against the vaccine, and had refused to get it when offered.  He'd been diagnosed with COVID about a week earlier but wouldn't seek medical care outside of getting his personal physician to prescribe the anti-malarial drug  hydroxychloroquine.  He'd been sitting at home for the past week with difficulty breathing getting worse and worse.  When he finally collapsed in to unconsciousness, she called 911.  

What made me want to vent about this was reading an article this morning that talked about a member of Congress who'd had his YouTube account suspended for posting COVID misinformation where he railed against the vaccine and touted treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.  He was complaining that he was being censored and that there was no harm in encouraging people to seek alternative treatments.  Well yes, Congressman, there IS harm in suggesting alternative treatments, especially when you tell people they should ignore the CDC and all the medical experts.  

I'm so sad for my friend.  Her husband left her behind with two children under 10.

For anyone planning to get a booster, make sure you have the next day free.

I got my booster yesterday at 5pm. Woke up at 1am and felt awful. Took some Tylenol but couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get back to sleep because I was so achey and uncomfortable. Keep sleeping and waking up, taking Tylenol every 4 hours. Got up at 6am to feed the dog, and I threw up! I was so weak it was hard to walk to the bathroom. Stayed in bed and was incredibly weak and achey with chills and a horrific headache until 3pm!! Felt like the flu.

"Stop calling the covid-19 gene therapy a vaccine!!
What is a vaccine? Wikipedia:

&gt;A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.

The problem is, this gene therapy does not introduce a an agent that resembles the disease. It uses mRNA proteins to code your body into producing antigens that then cause the body to produce antibodies. This is the first time in human history this has ever been done. It is NOT a vaccine, and the more you refuse to call it that the more people may start to understand the skepticism behind it. It is GENE THERAPY. 

Thats all, have an amazing day everyone(:",-1

Hi , I 25F (Asian) had my first shot of COVID Vaccine on 11th  June.

"No Side Effects After COVID Vaccine?
I had my first shot (Pfizer, if it's relevant) about 30 hours ago. My arm feels like I got in the way of an MLB swing, but other than that, I feel completely normal, which weirdly is worrying me.

Every medical professional I've spoken to has told me to expect fever, body aches, headache, fatigue, etc. but aside from the arm, I've got nothing.  What's going on? Does this mean it didn't take? Will these side effects hit me later even though it's already been almost 2 days? Did I just get lucky?

"First Dose of Moderna (5 months after having Covid-19)
Hey guys,

I just wanted to provide an update on my experience with the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, yesterday 4/31/21, and was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, differences, etc? As I mentioned, I had Covid over Thanksgiving, so late November. It was miserable. It is obviously considered a mild case because I did not require supplemental oxygen, nor was I hospitalized, but nonetheless, it was awful. However, I feel it is disrespectful to complain about it, given the fact that 3.18 million people around the world have died from Covid/Covid related complications.  I got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine and have felt sooooo shitty since 8 pm last night. Got shot at 11:30 am. Fever, chills, body aches, sore arm, G.I. distress, fatigue, and some. My question is if anyone has also had a bad reaction after the first shot after having had covid previously, and was also wondering if it's likely I'll feel much worse after the second shot a month from now. I have done some reading and it makes sense as to why I'm having nasty side effects after the first shot because my body recognizes the virus and is doing its job building more antibodies, etc. Anyway, I figured I would just share my experience. I will certainly be getting the second shot because I do want to have full immunity to not only protect myself but be less likely to transmit it to others. I hope everyone is doing as well as one can be during these trying times, though I do indeed see light at the end of the tunnel.",1

Honestly, FUCK YOU! You've forced us to change our entire way of life, adopt a shitty, dystopian ""new normal"" against our will, allowed corrupt governments to fucking swell with power, made us isolate ourselves completely to the point where people are fucking killing themselves just to escape the depression and clown-world you've created, and made it fucking mandatory to wear a fucking piece of cloth on our face outside because YOU'RE afraid of a fucking cunty little meme virus that does FUCK ALL! 

Now you fucking turn around and mock us for being afraid/skeptical of a fucking experimental, Game of Thrones Season 8-level rushed, non-FDA approved vaccine that's going to be put into our bodies and do God knows what. You fucking hypocritical, sanctimonious little cunts. I am not fucking having it, stick it up your arse if you fucking love it so much, have them squirt that fucking shit up inside you because I AM NOT TAKING IT.

Even if I wasn't deathly afraid of needles (I am, but fuck me and my fear, right?) I wouldn't have this slurry pumped into my fucking body. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE LONG TERM EFFECTS. You still have to wear a fucking mask and socially distance after having it; they're still pushing to keep those restrictions for fucking years even though half of Britain's adults have had the fucking thing; and now they're pushing for vaccine passports just to go to the fucking pub which is so fucking discriminatory and so fucking dystopian that it's fucking hammered the final fucking nail in the coffin for me: NO.

I've had it and so far so good. I'm fine and I'm not dead! I felt the pinch but it was just like any other injection. Today I've got a very sore arm as expected.

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m a 15 year old girl, and what IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m pretty sure falls under the classification of mentally disabled. I have a *very intense* phobia of needles, so even if this wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t a COVID vaccine IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d still be in a lot of distress. My parents are, for some reason, utterly hell-bent on getting me this vaccination even though it is almost completely unnecessary for someone of my age and health. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve even shown them the statistics, around 6,000 females aged 10-19 have gotten COVID here in Australia and zero have died. Zero. But yeah, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll totally end up in hospital on a ventilator as they like to mention constantly.

Anyway, to the point. Every week, they have scheduled a vaccination appointment and have forced me to go, every week. They claim I have a choice in the matter (spoiler alert, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t), and have so far allowed me to leave each appointment as unvaccinated as I came, although I only know itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s matter of time before they let the nurses restrain me as theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve done before. Today was the second appointment, the third is next Wednesday. I essentially has a mental breakdown both times and was unable to speak for the majority of the time in the clinic. I have lost several hours of sleep in between appointments due to the cruel systematic trauma I am being subjected to. My nerves are fried and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m constantly tired from the constant panic attacks. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t know how this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t considered some form of child abuse, considering I have stated I do not consent both appointment and they wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t stop. 

My parents have now resorted to a shaming and fear-mongering tactic, mentioning how the vaccine will ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœkeep me safeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœprevent me from dying.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â Excuse me? Are we even living in the same reality? I am statistically more likely to die from pricking myself on a sharp object than dying of COVID. Sure. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re also constantly bringing up the inhumane vaccination passports we have here in Australia, saying that I wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get to see my friends (AKA have passable mental health) or attend my own therapy sessions if I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get vaccinated, because THAT will keep me safe. 

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m done. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t do this anymore, the pressure is too intense and ability to maintain a stable mental state is deteriorating with every day. How on earth do they see themselves as the heroes here. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t think thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s anything I can do against this, I just kind of wanted to vent as none of my friends believe me on this. I know itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s cliche of a teenager to say, but I hate my parents and I hate the Victorian government.

Edit: I spoke to my mother over dinner, and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s now considering sedation. I just donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get it. I cited the Victoria governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s COVID statistics and they werenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t having it, they instead proceed to claim that this vaccine is somehow the most important vaccine in human history and that me not getting it is me risking death. If I go outside I am risking being truck by lightning, if I go in a car I am risking being killed in an accident, how is this any different. Still arenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t having it. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll keep trying IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll promise you that, but at this rate I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t know how long I can keep doing this, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s like talking to a brick wall.

On Youtube.com a video clip by Mike Figueredo of 2 weeks ago showed clips of a Covid wing of an Arkansas hospital. True to form, they were unvaccinated (idiots ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” oops! Editorial comment here)!

A physician on the unit was asked how many families he could persuade to get a vaccination, given the deadly circumstances they found themselves in. The physician said that it was very discouraging ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” only about a fifth of the families said that they would consider it.

Think of it ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” you are close to death, or a family member is dying or is close to death, and even then 80% of the time you reject consideration of Covid! Breathtaking (and breath-ending) result!

I've heard frequent stories of people who had bad vaccination experiences but there must be a lot of people who had only mild side effects.

What side effects did you experience with your First shot and Second shot and how long did they last?

Personally;

First shot: Pfizer - Sore arm for a day.

Second shot: Moderna - Sore arm for a day, tired for 5 or 6 days and a runny nose.  Fine after that.",1

"/u/danjvelker on What is your opinion on the covid 19 vaccine?
I agree. Well written and cited. And (though it's entirely possible) I don't think we need to attribute any sort of malevolence to these groups in order to say we don't trust the vaccine. It's simply enough to say that it has been so politicized and sensationalized that it's likely it was either rushed, or has some unknown or unadvertised long-term effects. We know this is often the case with new vaccines of any kind. Even if we don't assume that these corporations are not acting malevolently (which I don't think we ought to assume) there's plenty of reasonable ground to be suspicious of the vaccine.

"Experience with Gilenya/Fingolimod and the Pfizer/Biontech Covid vaccine
Hi everyone, 

I just wanted to give a short update on my experience with the vaccination process. It's not meant to scare anyone but to help others navigate the process.

I'm male, in my 30s, diagnosed in my early 20s. I got my first vaccination in April, and the second one in May. After both shots, I had mild symptoms like tiredness and muscle pain. After two weeks, I got my antibodies checked because I was aware that Gilenya might interfere with the vaccination.

Unfortunately, I developed almost no antibodies, most likely because of the medication. Antibodies are only an indicator for immunity, but after two months I grew a bit impatient and got a T-cell-response-test which was negative, too.

Last week, me and my neurologist decided to give a third vaccination shot a try. It's not really clear if this counts as a booster shot or just a new try. He also said that some of his Gilenya-patients did indeed have a response after the second shot, which was not the full antibody count, but still enough to assume a certain level of protection.

So if you're a Gilenya patient and in doubt, please consult your neurologist to discuss this issue. I'm sure that we'll have a guideline in a few months.",1

"COVID-19 Vaccine - Pfizer Second Dose Experience
*****words are censored but potential TW?*****

This is all based on my personal experience but I was so anxious to get the vaccine so I want to help others who are too! 
I am now almost 17 hours post second vaccine. I had COVID last March so I was worried I would have bad side effects. My first vaccine made me feel tired, have headaches, and maybe a little upset stomach (mightÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been anxiety) but nothing where I thought I would be s*. So far for the second shot, I have a sore arm and a little tired. 
I did read that if you already had COVID, the first vaccine will be more tough on you than the second one is. But I never once felt n* or like I was going to v*. The anxiety was the hardest part for me. I never wanted to sleep because I was scared of waking up sick. 
I made sure to drink tons and tons of liquid before my second shot. This was before I knew my first shot wouldÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been the one where I had an issue most likely. I drank two vitamin waters and three smart waters before the vaccine and then I had one smart water, three glasses of water, and pedalyte after the vaccine. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m still now sipping on pedalyte and smart water. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m feeling okay and just a little sore arm.

DonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t let the fear prevent you from getting vaccinated. You will be OKAY!! I was extremely n* when I had COVID and I know that this vaccine will protect me from feeling that way again.

"My experience with COVID vaccination
I'm putting down my experience with COVID vaccination, as an appreciation for our hard working healthcare workers and as a what-to-expect guide for people who will take the vaccine soon.

I had an opportunity to take the vaccine through walk in registration in a government hospital. I just had to go to the location with my government employee id and my Aadhar card. The security guard at the entrance gave each person a small piece of paper with a stamped form for your name and phone number. There was a short queue of about 7 people waiting for registration which took about 10 minutes. 

Once inside, you go to the registration desk where they check your photo ID and your eligibility. If you have not already registered on the COWIN website (I wasn't), the person there will take down your information, take your photo and your photo ID's picture and upload it to the COWIN registration database.

Then you walk into a nurse's chamber where they ask you questions about your health, allergies, previous COVID exposure. The nurse gives you information on what vaccine is being given, what to expect and what to look out for. There is an instruction pamphlet given for identifying strong side effects and contact numbers for the COVID war room and local hospitals. They note down your details for the future.

In the next room, they give you the vaccine and repeat the details about what they are doing, step by step. I'm supposed to get an sms to remind me to take the second dose after 28 days. All of this has taken a total of 15 minutes since I walked in.

They ask you to stay for 30 minutes after vaccination to observe for any adverse reactions. You sit in a socially distanced hall and another nurse gives you detailed information about what to expect, what to do and not to do (drink plenty of water, don't rub the injection site etc). They offer a Crocin tablet to be taken in case of fever or headache. They also guided me through the process of downloading my vaccine certificate.

All through the process, the nurses and doctors were extremely professional and helpful. The conditions in the hospital were not that good --- it was hot (this was late afternoon) and there was no air conditioning or anything. They had been there since the morning but they were all very polite and smiling. It says a lot about our health care workers that they work with such dedication and humanity.

If you are a healthcare worker, please accept my big thank you. If you have the chance to get the vaccine, please get it asap. Do not hesitate unless your doctor tells you not to get it.

I wonder if this is behind the push here in America to send mental health professionals out on police calls.

As with most democrat policies, it sounds like a good idea on the surface,.  And it actually could be a good idea if used properly and not abused.

But what are the chances it won't be abused?  What what are the chances it won't be used to deem those who don't want the injections as mentally ill and force it on them?  I say slim to none.",-1
"Have any of you noticed an anti-COVID vaccine sentiment in the Assyrian community?
My parents, my brother, and I are all fully vaccinated. Unfortunately, plenty of my extended family and family friends are not, and have this strong opposition to receiving the COVID vaccine. Most of them live in San Diego, and have been attending protests against vaccine and mask mandates, particularly for school-aged children, citing that it's ""child abuse"" and part of a ""Communist agenda."" It's so frustrating, to say the least, because they make the rest of us look bad. Where is all of this coming from, and what can we do about it? It's like all of these aunties just got their degree from ""Facebook University"" and they believe whatever they see on there. 

Some of them should know better, too. My aunt is an engineer and her husband is a doctor...there's really no excuse for this.

Ever since I got the Covid vaccine my anxiety has been pretty high, I even almost had a panic attack after the injection.

I left immediately afterwards and about 5-10 minute later in the car I suddenly couldn't take a breath, like everything stopped. It wasn't like I couldn't take a deep breath or that I had a shortness of breath but that I literally just froze for  what felt like a second or two and couldn't take a breath or speak. After that panic struck me and I started shaking and feeling weak. That lasted about 15 or 20 minutes and now I'm writing this.

If the vaccines are effective, why does it matter if someone else is vaccinated?

If you have natural immunity, why is it recommend to take the vaccine?

If the creator of the PCR test (the test used to confirm a COVID case) said it shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be used to determine infection, why are we doing so? 

What is the PCR cycle threshold used by your state? Can it be too high? What is an acceptable level? 

Is there a national / international standard for PCR cycle thresholds? If not, what are some problems that could arise from a lack of standard?  

If the vaccines are safe and effective, why do the manufacturers require liability protections? Why does the government require liability protections if itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s mandating people take them with no regard for an individual's personal medical situation? What about employers? 

If the variants are the result of the unvaccinated, why did we not experience the rise of variants in 2020?

How do mRNA vaccines work? (No Googling!)  

How much mRNA is contained in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines?

Where does the spike protein produced in the body via vaccination go? What does it do when itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s there?

"I’m a university student who experienced a legal win against my university. I made a comment on a post a few days ago, and got so many responses that I decided to make a thread detailing how I got out of the mandate via religious exemption
Brief background: I got to Loyola Chicago, which was technically allowing exemptions, but not “accepting” any. I sent over seven different attempts this summer, and all were rejected with no reason given. A group of students was able to get in contact with Liberty Counsel, an Evangelical legal non-profit. I sent the attorney all of my correspondence with Loyola, and the letter of mine that they used to include me in their a case against Loyola was as follows (the other letters have worked for my friends at other universities, but for those facing strict mandates, Liberty Counsel easily worked with this letter) :


My personal religious beliefs prohibit the injection of foreign substances into my body. The Bible teaches that we shall keep the blood pure, and keep the seed from being mixed. When genetic materials from bacteria, viruses, yeast, animals, birds, and other humans are injected during vaccination, the blood is contaminated, and genetic changes occur. God warned against this. To do so would violate the teachings of the Bible. My objection to this vaccination is based on my deeply held religious beliefs. 

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations, while not using morally compromised cell lines in the  design, development, or production of the vaccine, utilized a confirmatory test employing the morally compromised HEK293 cell line in order to test the efficacy of both vaccines. The HEK-293 cell line is derived from human embryonic kidney cells harvested from an aborted fetus.  Thus, both vaccines are connected to the initial evil of abortion by utilizing fetal tissue in the testing process, and to take either vaccine would support the belief that abortion is acceptable, a belief that strongly contradicts my deeply held religious convictions. 

The AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination are even more morally compromised. The HEK-293 cell line was used in the design, development, and production stages of the AstraZeneca  vaccine, as well as for confirmatory testing.  The PER.C6 cell line, which was developed using retinal cells from an 18-week-old aborted fetus, was used in the design, development, and production stages of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as well as for confirmatory testing.  

My personal religious beliefs hold abortion to be against the will of God. “Thou shalt not kill”, Scripture tells us in Exodus 20:13.

I would like to point out at this time that the official Vatican position on COVID-19 vaccines can be found in its entirety here, and states:
    5. At the same time, practical reason makes evident that vaccination is not, as a rule, a moral obligation and that, therefore, it must be voluntary. In any case, from the ethical point of view, the morality of vaccination depends not only on the duty to protect one's own health, but also on the duty to pursue the common good. In the absence of other means to stop or even prevent the epidemic, the common good may recommend vaccination, especially to protect the weakest and most exposed. Those who, however, for reasons of conscience, refuse vaccines produced with cell lines from aborted fetuses, must do their utmost to avoid, by other prophylactic means and appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles for the transmission of the infectious agent. In particular, they must avoid any risk to the health of those who cannot be vaccinated for medical or other reasons, and who are the most vulnerable.

I Corinthians 6:19 tells us that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. Vaccines contain neurotoxins, hazardous substances, attenuated viruses, animal parts, foreign DNA, albumin from human blood, carcinogens, and chemical wastes that are proven harmful to the body. Injection of these substances violates the word of God, and subsequently my religious beliefs. 

I would also like to point out that I have not received any vaccination since coming of age and assuming full control over my own medical decisions. 

For the reasons outlined above, I will continue to exercise my right to exemption from vaccination according to my religious beliefs.

"Parents won't talk to me after telling them I want the Covid-19 Vaccine
I'm 19M, I'm from Italy and I live with my parents.

Both mom and dad are very strong conspiracy theorists but I always ignored that fact in order to achieve my peace of mind. Lately the conspiracy trend has been very strong in the whole country and recently they started coming out with new conspiracies every other day.

My grandma who is in her 80s is a conspiracist too, and her mental health has declined drastically in these last 2 years. She's not herself anymore. Blame Facebook.

All of us got Covid end of last year. My dad even went to the hospital. This was very sad to see after they have been bullying everyone that asked them to put a mask on. At that point I said to myself ""It was harsh, but they finally changed their mind"". Oh boy I was wrong. They fell even more into the rabbit hole.

Some weeks ago I made the enormous mistake of exploring that world. I fell, too. My time got wasted in a way you can't even imagine. I stopped working, I did nothing all day. Just watch theories. After a spark of clarity I realized how much that was like hard drugs, and how fragile that whole castle was since the most basic scientific research could destroy every argument. But that's another story.

My point is I informed myself, and I finally realized I was risking this whole time by not getting vaccinated. I think the only thing that saved me was post-covid immunity.

I don't want to get through covid again, I still have symptoms after one whole year (anosmia and parosmia) and the possible side effects of the vaccine are not even comparable to the ones of the virus.

I tried explaining this to my mom, the only thing she could say was ""I can't believe you're getting vaccinated"", went to her room, closed the door, and hasn't talked to me since then.

TL;DR: Parents are heavy into the conspiracy rabbit hole and don't want me to get vaccinated.

P.S: I doubt I will be able to change my parent's minds; there's a whole community supporting their beliefs, including friends and religion. My mom lost her job just not to get vaccinated, just so you understand.

I however need someone to tell me everything will be ok because the anxiety I have right now is too much (I'm diagnosed with general anxiety, I'm trying my best). Thank you.",1

"My friend doesn't wanna get the Covid vaccine.
I(19f) have a friend(17f) who I haven't seen in a whole year due to the pandemic. We talk from time to time and during one of these calls, I asked her if she got the vaccine. She said no. I asked her if she's anti-vax and she said she just doesn't want to get it if she doesn't have to (wtf does that mean?). She said the only reason she got other vaccines in the past was that they were required in school. I mentioned all the cases and deaths and reminded her she could die. She was mad I was only focusing on the negatives and told me she doesn't need the vaccine and would be fine if she caught covid. I list all the symptoms and asked her if she was ready to deal with them. She told me she'd cross that bridge when she got there. I told her it would be better to not have to cross that bridge at all, and she told me she simply will not be getting the vaccine. There is no lockdown where she lives and her parents aren't in good health. They aren't vaccinated either.

This all makes me very irritated because she doesn't even have a reason for avoiding the vaccine as Anti-vaxxers do. I think it's another case of teenagers thinking they're invincible because they haven't lived long enough for anything bad to happen to them. Her stubbornness on the matter has me concerned that she might not be telling the whole truth. There might be something else that she isn't telling me. I'm worried for her and her parents.

M24, 5ft 8, ~74kg. No issues apart from some migraines sometimes (and hayfever)

"To those with health-themed OCD who are struggling with the Covid vaccine...
One of my ongoing OCD themes revolves around health, physical symptoms, and long-term illnesses. When I feel a physical symptom, I have a tendency to ruminate over it and compulsively research, seek reassurance, and otherwise send myself into an anxiety spiral over it.

When it was my time to get the COVID vaccine, I signed up for Pfizer right away... and then promptly spent the weeks until my first appointment obsessively googling side effects, visiting subreddits like /r/covidvaccinated, and asking everyone around me about their side effects.

Some of the things I read obviously freaked me out. Comments like:

* ""*Everyone* I know who has gotten the vaccine is still sick from it months later""
* ""Here's a news article link to someone who died after getting the vaccine""
* ""I've developed X, Y, Z diseases and my doctor said it's from the vaccine""

I am in no way an anti-vaxxer and I logically knew that a) not everything I was reading was true and b) the chances of very bad side effects were so slim, but I admittedly still almost canceled **both** of my vaccine appointments multiple times.

Anecdotally, my vaccine experience actually went like this:

* First dose: arm pain for about 24 hours
* Second dose: arm pain, mild muscle aches, and fatigue for about 36 hours

I've been fully vaccinated for several weeks now. My entire family, my friend group, and over 60% of my office is also fully vaccinated. I have never heard a single person in real life complaining of the horrible side effects I read about before getting I got vaccinated. (For reference, my vaccinated family/work/friend group is about 75 people that I know personally).

The point of this post isn't to say that all of those people are lying (although I'm positive from looking at post history that a significant amount of them are just anti-vaxxers trying to scare people). I know that every vaccine carries a small risk for more serious side effects. 

But the point of this post is just to say that if you're in an OCD spiral over potential vaccine side effects, I see you. You're definitely not alone. Now that I'm fully vaccinated and had such mild side effects, I can't believe I almost canceled my appointments.

I'm proud of each and every one of you who goes through that spike in OCD and anxiety symptoms and overcomes it to protect yourself and your community from this virus because I know how all-consuming those obsessions can be. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™Ã‚Â¡",1
"COVID arm?
I took both shots of the Moderna vaccine. First was in April in the right arm, second in May in the left arm. With my first shot I developed ""COVID arm"" a week later. My arm was super hot, super painful and horribly itchy, had a huge hard lump that was very swollen and a red rash that spread outward. It started exactly a week after my shot, grew worse for about three days then cleared up after a week. From what I understand this is fairly common with the Moderna shot and no big deal, although I have not personally seen any examples that looked as dramatic as mine. Nothing like this happened with the second shot, in fact I had no pain in my arm at all with it. I have seen lots of theories about this but I am experiencing something odd that I can find no information on and wonder if it could be connected to my fibro. It has been two months since my first shot and every now and then I get a very strange painful sensation in the exact place where I got my first shot on my right arm. It feels almost like a burning needle is going into my arm and it is also being squeezed too hard. There is nothing on my arm to indicate any pain and this never happened before my shot. I am worried that this is a new permanent fibro symptom. I am not even sure it is connected to my shot and have been wary of asking this due to people being scared of the vaccine. I don't intend to spread fear and recommend the vaccine but I am so curious about this. Has anyone else experienced anything similar or did anyone else develop COVID arm? I am hopeful this will go away and is not a new fibro thing. Can fibro cause you to develop painful places tied to physical synptoms that you experienced for other reasons?

"India: What do the Covid deniers have to say?
I remember when the news of Covid initially spread, Q was already denying it and spreading all sorts of rumours about it. 

They were at the forefront of spreading fake news and anti Vax BS that made it's way to all parts of the world, including India. A lot of people in India would quote articles and tweets from Q circles to spread the same propaganda. They believed it too. Until things got extremely bad.

What are members of Q saying now? Do they believe these people are falling dead on their own? India didn't has only managed to jab 1.4% of the population. Which means more will die. Im so angry at how they still continue to spread BS while people in India are dying in huge numbers.",1

He's my legal guardian and he forced the mask thing on me pretty early even though we live in a country where it never fully took off. Same with sanitising everything and keeping a distance and isolating if you get even a small cough or some shit. He doesn't support mass lockdowns and he's kinda on the fence about masks now after more research has come out so he isn't totally lost to this shit but he's in pretty deep.

Anyway he got vaccinated the second it was an option and we argued about it then. But even if I'm worried about him the freedom to choose should go both ways so he can take the risk if he wants to. Recently they made it so we can get the vaccine in my age group now and I kinda thought he'd tell me to get it but the more stories that come out about side effects for young people the more he talks about how dumb it is to take that risk. He says he wouldn't use me as an experiment for anything in the world because my age group is at a low risk and he thinks the risks of the vaccine for my age group are worse than any potential benefit. 

And this shit comes from someone who goes hard for the propaganda. This is someone with all the qualifications pro vaxxers are fucking obsessed with. Seeing as boys in the 16-17 age group are more likely to develop heart problems which got [confirmed toda](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2783052?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2021.3471)y just keep fucking resisting.

This sub is over run by people who cannot read and comprehend peer reviewed science! If you have a legitimate medical reason to not want the covid shot then I understand, but the vast majority do not actually understand how mRNA or vaccines in general work. You anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are ruining herd immunity and destroying lives of people who genuinely cannot get a vaccination because of their health. Frankly the real conspiracy is that so much misinformation has been swallowed up by a largely conservative audiences and mixed with distain in for scientists sitting in their ivory tower to create division on an issue where there should be none.
DonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be fooled by a YouTuber or clout chaser ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœalternative/internet doctorsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â because at the end of the day peer reviewed medical studies point to the vaccine being the best bet to survive covid. The unvaccinated created more opportunities for new variants that may be able to work around the current vaccinations.
And if you want another conspiracy, consider that CEOs and politicians alike have gotten the vaccine. If they didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t think it was really safe they would have tested it on the poor first.

"CMV: If you refused the vaccine or knowingly spread disinformation, you should not be given medical care if you get COVID.
I understand that doctors practice health to help anyone who needs it, but these people actively decided to put others at risk for no other reason than their political beliefs and radical misinformation. 

Hospitals are overflowing with people who absolutely refused to get the vaccine because of their political beliefs. Because of them, people who did get vaccinated and need emergency attention for solvable/treatable illnesses are dying.

Anti-Vaxxers are a waste of money, time, and emotional effort. We'd all be better off turning them down then telling them to die at home like in the era before vaccines. They are just a burden to us all and the reason we can't have our lives back.


I keep thinking, ""What would go wrong"" and I end up nowhere every time. They tend to be welfare queens and low-IQ voters, deeply racist, and generally unhealthy. If they all die, we spend less money on their states, the avg IQ of the American public goes up, we chip away at societal racism (systematic racism will still exist probably), and we can have a genuine conversation about health in this country without badfaith actors.",1
"Parosmia From Covid Vaccine?
I got my first dose of Pfizer 15 days ago. My second dose is Thursday. I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t notice any problems at first - my arm was a little sore for a day or two but that was it. Around a week ago, I was sleeping with the window open (I like it cold at night) when I was awakened by a blast of a chemical, metallic smell. I thought it must be truck or diesel exhaust coming through the open window. So I closed it and the smell seemed to gradually subside. But then a few days later I was sleeping with the window open and was awakened by the smell again. Then a couple days later I thought I smelled it around the window even when the window was closed. 

At first I thought there was legitimately some kind of fumes coming into my house. But recently I had the window open and smelled it very strongly, so I asked my wife and daughter if they could smell it and they said it smelled like regular fresh air to them. So it seems whatever is going on is specific to me. 

Now I smell it all the time, usually most strongly in my room next to the window that it originally seemed to come from, but more faintly in other rooms of my house. Seems like itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s probably parosmia and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m trying to determine the source. I know itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a known symptom/long term effect of Covid, but as far as I know I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t had Covid. My dentist makes all her patients get Covid tests before she will see them and I got one about a month ago because of that and it was negative. And I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t had any of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœclassicÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â Covid symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, etc) either. And nobody I live with or interact face to face with has gotten it either. I guess itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s still possible but seems weird if this was the only symptom. 

So now IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m wondering if may be caused by the vaccine. I know some people get flu like symptoms with it. Is it that out of bounds that it could cause more uncommon symptoms of Covid like parosmia? Has anyone else noticed anything like this?",0
"Got my first Covid shot!
So i just got my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine!  


A few days prior, i decided to get vaccinated on my own accord. I didn't need to be talked into having it. And i wasn't nearly as nervous going in as i thought i would be, considering my health anxiety and needle phobia.  


After i got my shot, it was kind of hard to tell what was an anxiety response or an actual side effect.  
The first thing that happened was that i got a little light headed, but that was to be expected from again my anxiety and fear of needles. And so far the only side effect that has me a little on edge was tingling in the face. Being a symptom of anxiety i don't know whether or not that  is caused by anxiety or a side effect of the vaccine.  


Obviously the instant that happened i thought i was having an allergic reaction and kind of had to collect myself. I'm still kind of feeling it, but again it's so hard to tell if i'm just fixating on it. But so far, my side effects are very mild.

So my Mom is a conspiracy theorist. 9/11 was an idea job, Obama is the Antichrist and now she's refusing to take the covid vaccine because it's the mark of the beast. She hasn't outright said it but she has heavily implied it.

What confuses me most is that she says repeatedly that she has no issue with me and my siblings and Dad taking the vaccine but her taking it would trouble her conscience. 

I'll add that she's also a pre trib dispensationalist because she has managed to loop all things covid into the rapture and end times. She is determined that I know the 'truth'.

Right now, conspiracies aside, my Mom has a number of underlying health conditions that primarily affect her respiratory system. She needs to get the vaccine because it would 100% be fatal if she contracted COVID. My Dad is weak and is just like 'hopefully she will come around just give her time'. I know this isn't likely unless 'God moves her to change her mind'.

"30yo Female. I just found out I'm pregnant. Should I get the second dose of the COVID vaccine tomorrow?
I am a 30 year old female. Taking no medications. No prior health problems.

Hi everyone!

I apologize if this question has already been asked; I'm very new to this group. I just found out I am pregnant (right at 4 weeks). I had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine about 5 weeks ago (I am a school counselor, at work five days a week and in constant contact with students - socially distanced and with masks). I am due to get my second shot tomorrow, but I am terrified of possibly having a fever and hurting my embryo. I miscarried my first pregnancy last month after ttc for almost a year, and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I did anything to jeopardize this pregnancy.

So my question is: is it more dangerous to risk a fever post-vax this early in pregnancy, or to skip the second vaccine and have a marginally increased risk getting COVID without a second dose? My husband is a doctor (not in immunology/internal medicine) and supports me either way. I feel so blessed to have been offered the vaccine so early, but now I'm just really worried about making the best decision.

My doc recommended going ahead with the second dose, but left the choice up to me. What would your recommendation be?

EDIT: I ended up getting the second dose today. I don't have the luxury of holing up inside my house until second trimester, and getting COVID during pregnancy sounds terrifying and dangerous. Decided to just take the risk that I had a better chance of controlling rather than risk getting COVID. 

Also, I learned today from my local health department that I would have to get both doses again if I waited any longer than 6 weeks between doses (until second trimester)...who knew! Apparently they can't prove the efficacy of the second dose if more than 6 weeks have elapsed between doses. Anyways, I am at peace about my decision; I don't have to worry as much about COVID for the remainder of my pregnancy!! Good luck to you all in the same position - this is a tough and very personal decision.",1

So I have some family members who are healthcare workers (specifically nurses) who are hesitant to take the vaccine. I understand being worried when it first came out but itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been about a year since they were first tested, about 5 months since they were distributed to the general public, and all the research done to create the vaccines came from previous studies. Being healthcare workers they already have priority access to it but of course they refuse to take it.

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not sure if I came to the right group to post about this but I guess I was wondering why my family members who are healthcare workers are suspicious about this vaccine.

"Lymph Node has been Swollen since COVID Vaccine
Late 20sF, white, 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™5, 125 lbs, no pre-existing medical conditions, no drugs/smoking/alcohol, my only medication is oral contraceptives.

I received my first dose of the covid vaccine in January and my second the end of February, I got moderna. Ever since about a week after my first shot my axillary lymph nodes on my left side have been swollen. The amount of swelling has varied, but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s always been enough that I can feel it. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been to my PCP who did routine blood work and found nothing wrong.

He also referred me to a breast center and the doctor there had an ultrasound down at my first visit and did an exam. She found nothing out of the ordinary besides the swollen lymph nodes and recommended I come back in July for a follow up ultrasound. That ultrasound showed they were getting smaller so she thought everything was fine and there was no need for me to do any further testing.

However, my lymph nodes keep randomly swelling up and becoming rather painful. They were very trigger when I got my flu shot a month ago. Since then itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been going up and down depending on the day, and today for some reason itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s fairly painful and swollen after not being all that noticeable the last few days.

"Girlfriend has “super cold” for 5 weeks now has her immune system been compromised by covid vaccines?
As title 5 weeks in her symptoms are worse than at the start , constantly sneezing, constant fatigue, runny nose ,blocked sinuses,coughing, rash on chest and sore sticky eyes mild headaches . Double vaxxed with Astra zenica  second jab about 8 weeks ago. 

No improvement in symptoms this girl has always ate super healthy and done personal training sessions min twice a week for the 4 years I’ve known her, just last 3 weeks she’s not had the energy for the gym. 

I’m worried her immune system has been compromised by the vaccines and I don’t want her taking any boosters but she refuses to see any link ( she was initially hesitant but gave in to family pressure) . 

Anyone know if her immune system is likely to recover if she doesn’t take boosters? 

Also she has a doctors appointment today are there any blood tests she should request that may help show what’s happening?",-1
"CMV:Hospitals should have the right to deny service to people not vaccinated against COVID
Listen...if you make the choice to not take the vaccine, it's not just a personal choice. You're actively endangering public health by giving COVID more host bodies in which it can grow and mutate. I think most of us here agree about that. So if you're willing to make such a selfish decision regarding this disease, you shouldn't be entitled to hospital care. Forget the hippocratic oath here - the hospitals here in America have only so many beds. Thoughtful people with emergencies are being turned away or having treatment delayed because hospitals are bursting at the seams with patients. It's frankly unacceptable that these people are being robbed of timely medical care because of the stupidity of others.

I'm not saying we should turn away ALL unvaccinated people from hospital lobbies. Rather, each hospital should dedicate a certain number of beds to these people. It doesn't matter what those patients are there for...if they're not vaccinated, they can only be assigned to these beds, that's it. Once all those beds are occupied, that hospital can then say ""sorry, no more room"" to any prospective unvaccinated patient.

If anything, having this policy in place might encourage a whole lot more people to go out and get jabbed, simply to ensure they get medical care in the event of an emergency. But more importantly, policies like this reward *good* behavior. We need more rules like this in place if you want people to start acting right, in my book. Bad decisions must have real tangible consequences.",1

I got the Pfizer covid vaccine. Both doses. I got it because I work in the ER, and I interact with covid patients very often. My hospital offered it for free, and my parents are older and have health problems which would make them more susceptible to covid, so I chose to get the vaccine. First shot hurt similar to a flu vaccine. Second shot might as well have given me covid. After two days, I had gotten a low grade fever, body aches, dizziness, fatigue, etc. That lasted for an entire day. I would still get it again, just be mindful to make sure you have two-three days off after your second shot.

"What we have is a case of liars and a crap vaccine.
Operating on the assumption that the vaccine does what it says it does (which is questionable) even with a 60% or so (right now they cite 95%) efficacy, thereâ€™s no way there would be this many breakthrough infections. I think their vaccine numbers are much, much lower than they publish. Look at the olympics. I think people are saying theyâ€™ve had the vaccine and not asked to present proof. So when they pop positive, oh, of course this athlete took the shot.â€¦â€¦

Also, this is anecdotal, but a few of my very libby friends went back to our home state to â€œget the vaccine.â€ The one dose J&amp;J. Why not all go together? Two of them even volunteered at a vaccine clinic. Remember when all those videos were circulating where a health worker was â€œgiven the vaccineâ€ and there was nothing in the syringe? 

I think way more people are lying about it than we realize. Iâ€™d wager only about 30-40% have actually taken the vaccine.",-1

"The Road So Far
A) The policies put in place have played a key role in orchestrating a dire situation, and it is all based off of the flawed testing methods:

1. **Flawed testing:** Rapid Antigen tests have a false-positive rate of over 90%. PCR tests are being revoked by the CDC as they are unable to differentiate between viruses. The method and reference standard developed for this assay was bunk to begin with.
2. **Misattributed Deaths:** if you go to hospital for *any reason,* you get tested for covid. If you test positive (highly flawed, remember!)  and then go on to die for *any reason* with 28 days of that test, you get put down as a with covid death. This is demonstrated on the CDC website, where they state that only 5% of people died *from covid*, rather than with it. Hospitals have been paid more per covid-related death in many parts of the world.
3. **Cases, cases, cases:** Media driven bullshit and fear mongering through ""high case numbers"", once again drive by... flawed testing. Results are meaningless without a solid testing method and reference standard. This is chemistry 101.
4. Faulty testing has been used to drive a casedemic, with most policies that are being mandated being tied directly to this fraudulent testing methodology. 

B) The response the the virus has been grossly exaggerated. 

1. Masks don't work to protect you against viruses. I don't care what you ""think"" you know. If you work with masks or as an RT, you know I'm right. Most of you have never worn a mask in your life prior to 2020. Stop believing a piece of fabric that is not properly fitted to your face (with no space for air to enter or escape other than through filters and egress valves), is going to protect you. It absolutely is not. Drop this fucking nonsense already.
2. Lockdowns, travel restrictions, isolation, and quarantining of people who *have tested negative for the virus,* is ridiculous*.* Even if you test positive, *the tests are entirely flawed.* Asymptomatic? You're probably not even infected. These are psychological measures put in place to distance people from each other. 
3. People are being instructed not to talk to each other in Australia. They may be spreading misinformation when they open their mouths.
4. People are told to ONLY believe what the government tells them in New Zealand. Unless it comes from the gov, it's not true. The unquestionable truth. This same rhetoric is making it's way around the world in various forms.
5. Quarantine for ""vaccinated"" people, is ridiculous. Wearing a mask if you are ""vaccinated"", is ridiculous.
6. Denial of acquired and cross-immunity is ridiculous. They are actively denying multiple antibody tests for the same patient. If you are in this camp, you may as well be telling us the world is flat. You are nothing more than a dunce. We have known this to be true for our entire lives. It's the *best* defense we have.

C) The vaccine is not a vaccine, nor is it safe.

1. It does not prevent infection. It does not prevent transmission. It does not prevent death. It *may* lessen your symptoms. This may be the worst ""vaccine"", ever.
2. If it was effective, ""vaccinated"" people would not need any kind of guidelines or restrictions. Instead, the are still getting sick and dying in larger and larger numbers, and being met with the same kind of restrictions as the un""vaccinated"".
3. Freak accidents post ""vaccination"" are growing. We know many famous people who have suffered issues and death all over the world. This is unlike any vaccine in history, and the instances don't appear to be slowing down. If anything, they are becoming more frequent.
4. As you may have guessed from the first point, you can still catch and transmit the virus - but because you now may have less symptoms, you have higher chance of transmitting the spike proteins to someone else if you are sick.
5. This isn't a vaccine.
6. Millions of people affected with side-effects at this stage. Tens of thousands are dead as a result of the shot.
7. People seem to always ""get covid"" soon after getting their ""vaccines"", all while they managed to avoid it for the 16 months prior. Interesting.
8. Doctors are diagnosing people with Bell's Palsy 30 minutes after ""vaccination"", and then telling those same people that it is entirely unrelated, and they should get the 2nd shot because it is safe. Completely measured and normal response, of course.
9. This isn't a vaccine.
10. Treatments are been entirely ignored. Fuck, treatment polices are not even being proposed. ""Stay home until you get really ill."" People are being gaslight through the media, through politics, through fact-checker shills, and through idiot politicians. There are 30 RCTs on Ivermectin *proving* it is effective. It has been on the market for 40 years. It is incredibly safe. It is also very effective at preventing and treating this virus. Yet, *no one in the media is talking about it.* It's almost as if they don't want you to even be aware of an alternative treatment - you know, one that actually works. Instead, it remains in a perpetual state of ""we need more evidence."" The fuck we do.
11. Most people that have died from covid (delta) in the UK over the past 6 months were vaccinated. 66% of them, in fact.
12. Every single day, more and more medical experts are speaking out, giving testimonies, and sharing their experiences which completely contradict all the lies and gaslighting in the media, and confirming the things others are sharing. Every single person who goes against the narrative goes through character assassination, without fail. This is no coincidence.
13. This isn't a vaccine - it's a potential death sentence.

If you haven't noticed that something is very wrong at this stage, you need to WAKE THE FUCK UP. We are sounding the alarm bells. What do we need to do to make you realize that something is very wrong here?

You know damn well things don't make logical sense. None of the measures make sense. It's all utter nonsense. Double standards *everywhere.* Government officials are often exempt. The rich and elites are exempt. They don't need to isolate when they travel on their private and chartered planes. The people making the rules don't even follow them. They mock us. They have parties and dine out while preventing you from seeing the loved ones they have subjected to their bullshit measures and brainwashing. They are laughing at you while they manipulate you with fear tactics designed by their teams of psychologists. You sit there glued to your TV and social media waiting for your next instructions on how to act, what to feel and what to think. But you don't even think, do you?

You know this isn't right.",-1
"This is NOT about Republican vs. Democrat.

Exerting myself by running or lifting seems to make me feel ill or out of breath. My heart does not seem to be racing or pounding, and my pulse seems normal.

I'm used to chest tightness and heartburn because I have GERD. But it's usually not constant like this, and it usually doesn't burn throughout my upper back.

"""Covid"" Data from UK
14,265 people died within 21 days of having the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 4,388 people died within 21 days of having the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine whose death allegedly involved Covid-19.  
Another 11,470 people died within 21 days of having their second dose of having a Covid-19 vaccine, and 182 people died within 21 days of having their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine whose death allegedly involved Covid-19.  
 

Therefore 30,305 people died within 21 days of having the Covid-19 vaccine in England during the first 6 months of 2021. A further 123,796 people also died 21 days or more after having the Covid-19 vaccine, but it’s currently impossible to know the exact parameters for the further deaths unless ONS release the data in response to a Freedom of Information request.  
 

This means people who had a Covid-19 vaccine account for 70% of deaths due to all causes (excluding Covid-19) during the first 6 months of 2021. It also means the number of people to have died within 21 days of having a Covid-19 vaccine (30,305) in a period of 6 months is eight times greater than the number of people who have died of Covid-19 within a period of 18 months (3,832).

&gt;**Does the FDA think these data justify the first full approval of a covid-19 vaccine?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Approval imminent without data transparency, or even an advisory committee meeting?

&gt;Itâ€™s like polio vaccine, everyone should have it. Full stop. We are too small too dense to play nice game with anti vaccine like American.

Except it's not like polio vaccine because the polio vaccine is not mandatory, and it has demonstrated long-term safety and efficacy (prevents transmission).

Unlike the Covid experimental injections.

&gt;The idea that everyone must be vaccinated against COVID-19 is as misguided as the anti-vax idea that no one should. The former is more dangerous for public health. The COVID-19 vaccines have been one of the few bright spots during this pandemic. While anyone can get infected, the old have a thousand-fold higher mortality risk than the young.  
&gt;  
&gt;By vaccinating older people, the country has saved thousands of lives.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is intense pressure on young adults and children to be vaccinated. Universities such as Colombia, Cornell, Harvard and Stanford require all students to get the shot as a condition of attending college normally. Young people looking for work are discriminated against if they are not vaccinated. It makes public health sense to require some vaccinations in some settings. However, in the case of COVID vaccines for young people, such mandates harm public health.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, all medical interventions should pass the test of providing more benefits than risks. For the COVID vaccine, this is decidedly true for older populations but it is not yet clear for younger people. While we know that COVID vaccines have common but mild adverse reactions, we will not know enough about rare but serious adverse reactions until a few years after vaccine approval.

\---

&gt;Anyone who refuses vaccine without medical reason should definitely have less privileges.  
&gt;  
&gt;With that said. Medical reason need to include long term effects on pregnancy and fetus baby development, as we don't have enough long term data. So forcing pregnant woman to Vaccinate is not an answer.

You are right to be concerned about long-term effects on pregnant women and their baby.

Young people are also at risk of unknown long-term effects.

In medicine, treatment is always based on cost-benefit analysis.

Treatment is warranted only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.

And it is highly questionable to force young healthy people to take experimental injections that are not clearly beneficial for them.

&gt;Just trust the experts.

Here's a quote from another fellow intellectual elite, u/ssepaulette:

Â« lol donâ€™t bother, most singaporeans lack critical thinking or have the capacity to think for themselves.

Intelligence is knowing what you donâ€™t know and what we donâ€™t know is 99%.

The immune system is complicated stuff and a rabbit hole as deep as the mariana trench or even space.

Even researchers and doctors who dedicated their entire lives to immunology with hundreds of thousands of hours still know very little about how our immune system works.

and you have these parrots chirping about how vaccination is 100% effective and anyone who refuse to take is retarded and subhuman.

fwiw i personally am vaxxed but absolutely will respect anyoneâ€™s choice not to.

&gt;**Immunology Is Where Intuition Goes to Die**  
&gt;  
&gt;Thereâ€™s a joke about immunology, which Jessica Metcalf of Princeton recently told me. An immunologist and a cardiologist are kidnapped. The kidnappers threaten to shoot one of them, but promise to spare whoever has made the greater contribution to humanity. The cardiologist says, â€œWell, Iâ€™ve identified drugs that have saved the lives of millions of people.â€ Impressed, the kidnappers turn to the immunologist. â€œWhat have you done?â€ they ask. The immunologist says, â€œThe thing is, the immune system is very complicated â€¦â€ And the cardiologist says, â€œJust shoot me now.â€

"Covid all in this together?
Since the vaccination program started I have started to hear about more covid breaches and justifying it because 'they have been vaccinated'.

My issue with this is until the vaccine started we were asked to protect the NHS and the vulnerable who are mainly 60+ as they are most at risk from severe sickness or death.

However today my brother and parents ignore lockdown travel 60 miles despite me telling them its not allowed. Thier excuse is my parents have had the vaccine.

A friend told me of a nurse having a dinner party for 8 adults last week because they have all had the vaccine

Another friend who's family are all front line support and medical all getting together, again vaccine is the reason.

My understanding is the vaccines gives 80-95% protection from acute illness or death but you can still get it and transmit. The vaccines teach your body to fight the virus. It's not a complete immunity. I accept there is growing evidence they prevent spread but only anecdotal and not conclusive. 

 I spent the last year doing my best and being all in it together. I have a growing feeling that once people are vaccinated there is a group that's are ignoring the rules says cause they are vaccinated. They don't seem to be thinking of the group effort who worked hard to protect everyone. 

Does anyone else feel the same way or is it just me?",1
"[Covid Booster] Mother was very ""confused"" after 2nd shot. Should she get the booster?
My whole family is vaccinated - none of us had bad reactions except my mother. She got her second shot (Moderna) in the afternoon and the next morning was acting very strangely. My dad found her sitting outside, head down on the picnic table, and she wouldn't raise it to talk to him. She just kept mumbling to help her get into her car (but her car wasn't even there and obviously she was in no condition to drive).

He called 9-1-1, and she seemed mostly recovered after about an hour. She refused treatment and refused to go to the hospital, so the paramedics didn't really do anything but check her blood pressure.

When asked about it later she said she felt very tired and confused, but seems kind of hazy about the whole thing. She says it felt like she ""couldn't wake up"". This was about 8 mos ago and she's seemed fine since then. She's now wondering if she should get the booster or what to do.

Age: 67

Sex: Female

Height: 5'6""

Weight: Unsure, but probably either normal weight or ""overweight"" by BMI.

Race: White

Location: Southeast US

Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): Arthritis, Cataracts

Current medications (if any): Tramadol daily, for arthritis pain in knees. Has been on this medication for years, unsure of dosage.

Edit to add: She's also going to be getting cataract surgery in a few weeks, so fully quarantining isn't really an option.",0
"Covid vax inflammation
Hi all, just thought id share with you some information. 
 I had the vaccine 7 weeks ago double dose. As of last couple of days the sound has now reduced to about 6/10 was 8/10. Also had a MRI scan and found the auditory nerve was actually inflamed causing the noise to be worse good news is it is reducing. 
My doc also said the booster shot will be available soon and he said i should have it as i have asthma. 

By the way it can take some 6 months for the noise to reduce so hopefully goes back to a 2/10.

"Asymmetric Warfare at its Finest: Shots Injected, Not Fired
If indoctrinating the military with Critical Race Theory was not bad enough, the Biden Administration’s Final Solution for the U.S. Military is now fully operational. As per the Pentagon, all U.S. military members must get the PSYOP-19 “Vax” by September 15th. Yes, the very same “Vax” that as per VAERS reporting at under 1% has murdered and maimed more test subjects than all of the vaccine deaths and injuries **combined** over the past 30 years. The very same “Vax” that damages 100% of all test subjects by inducing endogenous spike protein production, which is cytotoxic. Yes, the very same “Vax” that causes in varying degrees micro-clotting in 100% of test subjects. And let us not delve into the potential for cancer, prion production, premature dementia and a whole host of other suspected and wholly unknown side effects anywhere from 48 weeks to 5 years out. Exactly what a military whose average soldier has around a **99.9%** “COVID” **survivability rate** requires ASAP. A military with to date less than a rounding error of actual “COVID” deaths no less.

Yesterday, yours truly had a most disturbing chat with a Special Forces soldier. The gist of the conversation was that “all the good ones” are leaving the U.S Military ahead of September 15th, leaving only those that have no issue getting ‘Vaxxed” only to then commence rounding up any citizen that has declined this experimental gene therapy. Not just a brilliant means of forcing out the Patriots from out of the Armed Forces, but also the maiming and murdering over time of the remaining grunts, and compromised and indoctrinated brass.

The CIA has been running China ever since their Cultural Revolution was orchestrated by the very same nefarious forces that brought us the Bolshevik Revolution as well as the Nazi Party. As the historically well versed reader may know, the CIA was born from a most devious and depraved marriage between the OSS (Office of Strategic Services, the WW2 proto-spy agency) and their Operation Paperclip poaching of the very best and brightest SS Nazi war criminals that were imported back to America well before the last shots were fired and the cremated remains still smoldering. Ever since the SS Nazis we rolled up into the OSS into the CIA, we have had in America a gang of Fascist spies running this nation.

So what does the CIA have to do with all of this, and how does it pertain to the CCP’s plans to destroy the USA from within? Who exactly is brainwashing the populace with an **induced mass hypochondria hysteria psyop predicated on junk science**? See Operation Mockingbird. Who is running a “President” with severe dementia? Who ran the ultimate Manchurian Candidate “President” who quite literally materialized out of thin air only to be embedded as POTUS? How about the former POTUS who actually ran the CIA? And so why would the premiere Spy Agency, an extra-Constitutional agency at that. want to destroy the military and the nation it was allegedly tasked with protecting?

The dying, yet woke U.S. Military is readying to go after the anti”Vaxxers”, patriots, and all other “enemies” of the State. The gulags are being readied all across the nation. And the timing is ingenious, because we are quite literally weeks away from the real Pandemic as a direct function of “Vax” Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE). A perfect confluence of planned events that will justify the reinstatement of Lockdown 2.0 and accelerate the “Great Reset”.

So why go after the U.S. Military with this “Vax” when there is no risk whatsoever to the soldiers?

What do you get when you cross a Fascist Spy Agency with a Communist Superpower?

"It Finally Happened...
I work for Starbucks. This whole pandemic has already been difficult enough considering I am surrounded by coworkers who are SO pro-vaccine, constantly double masking, and ALWAYS making sure to include (covid-safe) whenever they text me about their lives/plans. I have already given in to wearing a mask. It is company policy and I have to make money somehow. It is still frustrating to me to this day because I have never deemed COVID as a threat and feel as though those who are fearful of it should be given the option to stay home and mask up whereas I on the other hand should be given the option to breathe fresh air and continue on with my life, knowing that hundreds of thousands of people die every year regardless of if there is a â€œpandemicâ€ or not. Anyway, I had a customer come in today and while I was making his drink he asked me if I had received the vaccine yet. I responded with a firm no and he suddenly got defensive. â€œWell, why not?â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m sure itâ€™s available to you! Half of my colleagues have been vaccinated so far, including myself! You should really get on that!â€

Iâ€™m sorry, but what the fuck?! Is it suddenly okay to ask people about personal medical information now? His badgering questions left me beyond frustrated and I simply responded with a fake, â€œIâ€™ll look into that.â€

Looking back, I really wish that I had asked him if he had gotten his annual prostate exam yet, you know, since it is suddenly alright to start asking strangers about their medical info.",-1
"Everyone is going to get COVID-19 (yes, even the vaccinated)
This seems to be something everyone has missed or forgotten about..  COVID-19 is here for good and you will get it at some point.  If we all get vaccinated it will get weaker and weaker faster than if we didn't and there will be less mutations but it is here to stay.

But for those extreme anti-vaxers, the dangerous and disgusting assholes, seeing their posts that they're fighting covid, sometimes even still in denial that it's dangerous, and then seeing that they're dead, it's just amusing to me while being depressed how much misinformation these cunts spread when they were alive.

"Covid Vaccine (Pfizer) Side Effect Questions - Strange Sensation in my Arm
 

**Hello Doctors of Reddit!**

**I am Female, 30, 210lb**

Here are all the details: I received my Covid Vaccine Pfizer first dose, on Aug 17 (exactly 2 weeks ago)Next Dose Scheduled for Next Tuesday 9/7. (in exactly 1 week)

After I got the shot, I had headaches and fatigue. I know these things are normal and expected - no big deal there.

What I am concerned about is a strange sensation I am now having in my arm. Its the same arm that I received the shot. The sensation I have is of cold water running though the veins on my arm. While simultaneously feeling like I have sunburn on the outer layer of my skin. SometimesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦. I experience a pin and needles feeling that comes and goes. The shot was given in left deltoid, but the sensations I am having are happening from my elbow down to my wrist on left arm only. (I am not feeling it in my fingers) Rubbing/massaging it makes it feel funnier.

I've never felt this before ever, but it occurred right after I got the shot (like 20 mins later)And i thought it would stop... but its been 2 weeks now and hasn't stopped.

My questions are:

1.) Is this a normal side effect for this vaccine? - or perhaps could this be from a the needle itself?   
Perhaps the vaccine administer hit something inadvertently.

2.) What is this sensation called in medical terms? I looked at VAERS but I don't understand all the medical terms thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦ and I would like to report this side effect.

3.) How can I make this sensations stop? Its really annoying, it keeps me up at night wondering.

4.) Could this be a sign of something more dangerous?

5.) Should I get shot #2?

"Got both COVID vaccine shots!
hi everyone! just wanted to give a little insight and inform some people on my experience with both covid vaccines (i got pfizer btw!) 
so obviously i have awful health anxiety and also have fibromyalgia and ibs so iÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m always extremely aware of bodily sensations so i was extremely worried about side effects from both or either shot. 
shot 1: got it around 2 pm. the shot itself didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t hurt and it was quick and i waited my 15 mins and went home. that afternoon i *maybe* felt sleepy and laid down for like 30 mins. never felt anything else besides a pretty sore arm for a few days but no other side effects. 
shot 2: got it this past friday (5/21) at 2pm and same thing, shot didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t hurt, waited 15 mins then went home. a few hours later i started to really feel tired but it passed. around 8 pm i started to get muscle pain. i usually always have joint and muscle pain but it seemed like it was amplified quite a bit. i took 2 extra strength tylenol and it helped a lot and i laid down to sleep. around 2 am i woke up with horrible body aches, fever, and chills. didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t really sleep again until i took more tylenol at 6:30 am and slept until 10:30 am. all of yesterday i had muscle and joint pain, body aches, malaise, fatigue, and no appetite. 

no let me say this. i know weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re all scared of those side effects, but today i feel about 90% back to normal. i still have some aches and pains that are worse than usual but all of the feverish body aches, malaise, fatigue, and no appetite are gone. so from my experience, get the vaccine. it will save so many lives, including yours. i was sooooo worried about how i would feel after the shot, and then what i thought would happen, happened. but the thing is, i KNEW it would happen!! it didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t catch me off guard or make me feel like i was spiraling or something was terribly wrong. so yes, more than likely youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll feel sick for a day or a little more, then thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s it. but youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re *not* sick. itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s just your immune system working and preparing if you catch COVID. 
thanks for reading and i hope this helps people. i know itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s scaring and feeling sick is scary and it sucks but this is the only way to beat this virus! whoever is scared and worried about anything has every right to, just know itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s temporary and youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll be doing a great thing and can start getting your life back!",1

During the shot I only felt the needle at the surface of my skin. The vaccination itself took 5 seconds

5 minutes after the shot - Slight tingle all over lasting quickly, about five seconds

10 minutes after the shot - Throat dried up (I was extremely nervous all day the day of the shot)

1 hour to 48 hours after the shot - Sore injection site (it was worst about 10 to 24 hours in. CouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t sleep on it or use it). DidnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t sleep well the first night due to anxiety mostly 

24 hours after the shot ... through ... maybe now still? - Slightly tired than usual but this area did experience a cold front it went from sunny and warm to downright miserable with even some snow but now itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s seasonal out. Still maybe not ALL of my energy is back yet but close

"/u/whisporz on Are you getting the Covid shot?
I am healthy and young. Why would I get a vaccine for a virus that doesn't kill healthy people my age. Someone else can have it that needs it.

"covid vaccine side effect?
Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am 25 years old, male from Canada, 155 pounds 5'9. 

 I received pviser vaccine about a week ago and Ive been having muscle twitching throughout my body for the last week non stop. In my legs mostly, my right eye and sometimes my arm and back. Does anyone know what it could be? is it possible its a temporary side effect?",0
"An update to my covid vaccine availability texting app
Hey guys, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve got about 150 people signed up to be notified if there are vaccines available now. I did a little update last night and now it searches within 50 miles of Des Moines. 

I got a vaccine because of it this morning so it does work. Just wanted to let you know that the vaccines go extremely fast, so have photos of the front and back of your insurance card on your phone or computer to upload. 

If one of the time slots isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t available, try a different time slot. 

Sometimes there are only small amounts that open up and by the time you get to the page they could be gone. That doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t mean the app isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t working, just that people are fast. 


If you got a vaccine or donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to receive the texts anymore text it stop. 


Thanks!

**Edit- Hyvee has set a queue on their website now so my app is not useful anymore. If anything changes IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll update you!",1
"Natural immunity
I got the v1rus a year ago and it wasnâ€™t harsh at all on me. I got a test for immunity 2 days ago and I had an abnormally large amount of antibodies still in my system. If the CDC is saying â€œget the v4ccine because we donâ€™t know how long immunity lastsâ€ why donâ€™t they want people to just get a simple test and make informed decisions???",-1
"How to combat vaccine hesitancy and covid misinformation?
I have a friend who will not get vaccinated. She believed COVID is a hoax and that they vaccine kills more people than it protects (I know, I know). Her two jobs are now at risk because she refuses to get vaccinated (one is in the dental field and the other is with youth). What can I say or present to her that might help her see that vaccination is the right thing to do? Part of me thinks sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s too far gone, as she has said sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d rather be unemployed then get the vaccine. At this point sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s looking at having no job and no freedom to anything non-essential.",1
"Should i go to the concerned about these side effects from the covid vaccine?
So I (21f) got my second vaccine one monday and when i had my first one i had similar symptoms although this time i had mega chills. Both times i had this weird pain in my chest but it did not feel like it was in my heart, it felt like the back of my chest. Right now im experiencing it worse, im legitimately scared because the pain is so bad but its like a sharp pain, goes away for a tiny bit, then come back. This time it feels more centered in my chest. Does anyone have any advice for what I should/can do? Or have any idea what it is? I took like 4 ibuprofen and am thinking about taking a benadryl tablet to hopefully help, its 2am and im like wide awake and not able to sleep cause the pain keeps coming and going. I ate some chicken and rice and i swear for a moment the pain went away, or maybe i was just really enjoying my food. Im so confused tired and in pain at this point idk what to do. I dont think its a heart attack cause im young (although i am overweight woops) and i havent really had any health scares before,!and if it was well this happened before so I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t think iÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d of just been okay if it was. I honestly am looking for any kind of advice wether its something to help me or what im experiencing.

Update: heating pad does wonders?? I didnt expect it to help because itsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦. Just a heating pad. But my god it does help. Wait nevermind that was just the pain subduing for a second. God dammit",0
"I'm Sick of Hearing Covid-19 PSAs Everywhere I go
I understand the dangers of Covid-19 and the importance of the vaccine. I already got my vaccine and following guidelines. But I've just about had it with the constant reminder of Covid-19. Want to watch a YouTube video? Got to give you an ad about Covid for the 420th time today. Want to just buy groceries at Walmart? Let me tell you about the vaccine. Want to see what you're friends and family on social media? Let me tell you about how you can prevent your family from getting Covid. I'm tired of it going  after almost 2 years of this and it's still going on. 

Seriously, what is the point of these 
announcements? I get they want to raise awareness, but at this point we've known about the dangers of Covid-19 for almost 2 years. The vaccines have also been out for almost a year. At this point, pretty much everyone understands what's going on. And if the point is to persuade people who haven't got the vaccine or not following protocols, do these people honestly think shouting the same messages OVER and OVER again is going to magically persuade them? Because I think not!",1
"IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m 4 weeks late since getting the COVID vaccine and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m kinda scared
IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m 28 and ever since I got my first period at 13 it has always been extremely regular. I could predict a year in advance when exactly I was going to get my period and how long it would last. The only time this ever changed was when I started birth control at 18. I only took it for 3 months because it screwed up my cycle so bad, and when I stopped I bled for 6 weeks straight. After that I went right back to my normal routineÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦until 2 months ago. I got the second Phizer vaccine June 25th and got my period that day. Lasted 5 days. I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t gotten it since. I should have gotten it late July but itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s now late August and I still havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t gotten it. And before anyone suggests the obvious, I am gay and havenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t had sex with a man in 10 years lol. 

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve seen a couple people mention their cycles being unusually heavy after getting the vaccine or being a couple days late but after an entire month IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m really getting worried. Is this something others have experienced and is it normal? I mean obviously who knows what really is normal when it comes to this vaccine butÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦is it common?

I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t have insurance so I canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t go to the doctors unfortunately so here I am ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â˜Ã‚Â”",0
"""In other words, you become a dead end to the virus. And when there are a lot of dead ends around, the virus is not going to go anywhere."" - Dr. Fauci, May 2021. Now they are saying the vaccine was never supposed to stop transmission? Stop the gaslighting!

The vaccine was always about stopping transmission until they realized the experimental mRNA injections didn't work, then flipped the narrative. Doomers don't question it, they just rearrange their memories and beliefs. Real Eastasia/Eurasia vibes.

The other survived after two Pfizer, never had a clot or any health issue in his life, now is on a blood thinner.

Firstly, let me just say that thanks to the tireless work of our nation's finest. I can happily say I have had my first does of the COVID-19 Vaccine today.

For all those worried about it. Do not panic. I can safely say that my experience was rather delightful. The nice nurse who administered it was very helpful and friendly.

I have since sensed a huge relief and immense hope that this is a very big step into the right direction for returning to a bit of normality.

Thanks for reading.


Edit: Quick update for those wondering. It has been 12 hours since the injection and I can happily say I have no side effects other than a sore arm at the injection site and a very mild headache.",1
"I'm against forced covid vaccination.
I don't expect you to agree with me but please don't attack me. I got one of the earliest strains of covid and haven't gotten it since. Now, several people keep urging me to get the vaccine even though I've told them I have natural immunity and accuse me of being selfish. I'm fine with vaccines in general and do believe they work, but I don't believe forcing them onto people is going to solve any problems.

This is truly something I just wanted to get off my chest. I know there may have been plenty of these posts already and I'm just adding to the pile and that's fine. If you're just going to tell me to get vaccinated save your time, I don't need advice right now, just wanted to vent. Thanks",-1

I cannot express enough how grateful I am for her.

So, ive had both jabs (astra) in my left arm by the HPV jab. 

The first one, not much if an issue. Bit stiff the day after, bit if a lump at the injection site.

Second jab, been 4 days and the site is still raised and red and intermittently itchy... seems to have reacted to the HPV jab but it cohkd just be the swelling (im a picker and it went keloid)

I faithfully wore a mask, practiced social distancing, repeatedly washed my hands (which I do anyways), etc. Now I really DGAF about you.

"Dr. Robert Malone has been slandered constantly as a “fake” but he is the creator of the platform still used to produce mRNA vaccines.

Please upvote this! This needs to be seen by as many eyes as possible! There’s an attack on Dr. Malone taking place claiming that he only did a peer reviewed study on mRNA which is absolutely false.



Dr. Malone has a major problem with how the vaccines are being pushed out as they should be distributed on a risk reward scale and not forced.

He also has concerns with the FDA and the pressures put on by “group think”.  An FDA approval could in fact happen but that does not mean it’s safe.  It’s fact that the CDC does not approve of adverse effects being shared with the pubic.  I’m not saying there’s a huge conspiracy, I’m saying what we consider to be so unethical it would have to be conspiracy  is actually standard operating procedure for the CDC.  Not to mention their recently gained political power to put temporary laws in place like the eviction ban😂   The left is so unbalanced now that their unconstitutional actions just happen daily.

The slander of this man is exactly that.  Watch this video and learn the facts!

There is indeed an issue with creating a leaky vaccine that can allow virus to spread without killing the host or killing the virus.  You create a super bug over time and will become highly immune dependent on vaccines in the future.

"If your employer mandates vaccines, THEY are the ones liable if you get injured by it
At the very least, get a lawyer to say that the Moderna vaccine was created in two days and that they are still experimental/not FDA approved. So if the mandate it, rather than suggest, they will be liable for any sort of illness or side effect one may get from them. 
An employer mandated vaccine is considered part of work. So under most state laws, adverse effects caused by them which sicken an employee should be covered under workmanâ€™s comp. but they will only be liable if they mandate it. If you get the vaccine because they recommend it, then you wonâ€™t be protected by workmanâ€™s comp if anything were to happen.

The Vaccine is not going to kill you. The current strain is not going to kill you...however the next strain will. The vaccine will kind of protect against that strain but it will kill off all the people who refused the vaccine. Guess who those people are. They are the masses who stand up to the elite and defy them. They do not need these people and this method will ensure that all of them will get eliminated. The vaccinated masses will even rejoice and say that ""they got what was coming to them...They defied the mandates and now they are gone...good riddance..."".

Despite having gone through a rigorous approval process, there is widespread distrust over the safety of new Covid-19 vaccines. Partisan politics, which pervaded the vaccinesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ development and the pandemic response as a whole, plays a part, and a recent survey found that one in four Republicans ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜definitelyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get a vaccine.

"Anyone get ""covid arm"" within the first 24 hours following second dose?
I just got my second dose of Moderna on Monday afternoon (first dose Moderna too). On Tuesday morning I had a small 1"" rash below the injection spot and it has slowly grown to about 4"" by 3"" now on Wednesday afternoon. It's warm, slightly swollen, ""feels hard"" compared to my other arm.

I also had the more typical symptoms of fever, chills, headache that are just starting to subside now. For reference, the first dose I did not have covid arm or any other symptoms really.

Everything I have read about online has suggested most get covid arm like a week or more later, with some in two days. Maybe there's just not enough reporting on it yet? I just want to know I'm not the only one and I can't find anything online.

EDIT: Thanks for the reassurance everyone! The rash started fading last night. Now, Friday, it's a pretty light rash, not hot anymore and just feels a bit tender like a healing sunburn. ",0

"Endometriosis and COVID Vaccine side effects
I had my second Pfizer vaccine on Monday. I've been reading feedback here, as there is no real study going on about the effects of the vaccine on other illnesses. So thank you to everyone who has been reporting in, your experiences have been invaluable and helped me prepare for my own vaccines.

I have DIE Stage 4, and I've had 18 operations for it all up (I was diagnosed very young). I have had a total hysterectomy, but because it is in the bowel wall, pelvic wall and bladder wall, I am still considered to have Stage 4 endo, just inactive without a hormonal cycle to trigger it. My HRT is very carefully managed to avoid that. After reading feedback here, I had decided to wait for the Moderna vaccine as we currently only have Astra Zeneca and Pfizer available in Australia. But then we got a Delta outbreak and I didn't think waiting was worth the risk (Moderna is still months away). I'm unable to take AZ for medical reasons, so it had to be Pfizer despite reports of flare ups.

So, the first vaccine was fine. I had a migraine for 2 days, and a sore arm for a few days after that, but nothing too bad. I was hopefully that I would be spared any potential flare ups due to having had a hysterectomy.

However, then I had the second dose on Monday. I got a 3 day migraine again. But worse than that, I've had severe stabbing pain in my lower abdominal area for the first time in 3 years. It is intermittent, lasting about 5-10 minutes, and happens 2-3 times per hour. It has been going on for days now. I had an appointment with my GP yesterday and made him note it on my medical record, and I'm going to send an email to my specialist so he is aware too.

I don't regret getting vaccinated, but I have NOT missed this pain. I've been endo pain free for 3 years, I've almost forgotten how to cope with this.",0

I am 32 years old.
I have crohns since 2011
I used melasamine, then azathioprine(imuran) and now stelara.
I had around 4 big flare up in my life and I consider myself to be really lucky as I barely have symptoms when I'm using my medication and I eat wtv I feel like eating. I used the medication for around 3 years each before it stoped working and I had to swtich to another one.

Saturday 24th: I wake up. Take a big bloody poop. Then I go take my second dose of pfizer. 
(Keep in mind that the 3 weeks before the shot I was going 15 times a day to the bathroom with pain and blood in my stool).

8h45 AM - I take my shot
No more pain or need to go to the bathroom. 
I went 24h after my shot to the bathroom. I have no pain and no blood in my stool.
Since saturday I went to the bathroom once everyday and I have no pain or blood. 

I informed my doctor's nurse about the situation but she thinks that there is no link between the vaccine and how it magically changed everything for me ....

"A detailed experience of both my Covid shots
For me personally I like to hear people's experiences through the lens of severe anxiety, so here is a breakdown of my two doses for anyone who is putting theirs off due to fear! ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤ *of course this is only my experience and yours may differ but mine is fairly textbook.

Dose 1: Went to a walk in vaccination centre. I told the intake nurse I was terrified of both needles and side effects. She sat with me and let me know what the real side effects could be and gently dismissed the not real ones I had in my head. She took me to a private room with a bed to lay down on and offered me juice and cookies which was super sweet haha. She said I could sit there and relax for as long as needed before the shot but I told her if we didn't do it now I may run out lol. 

The actual shot- I know you've heard this before but genuinely it barely hurt. Felt more like a pinch than a needle and it was done in under one second. After it was over I had a massive panic attack and felt faint so they gave me the juice box and got me cold paper towels for my head. Panic attack lasted 5 minutes but I laid there for 25 minutes to make sure I was alright and they never asked me to leave earlier. 

Side effects:

Day 1- no side effects.
Day 2- sore arm only.
Day 3- nothing!

Dose 2: Same experience with the walk in centre. Everyone is super nice and doesn't care if you act like a baby, they have seen it all and just want you to be vaccinated and healthy! Shot managed to hurt even less, still had a panic attack but this time came prepared with my own ice pack and the panic lasted less time. Didn't need to stay longer than the 15 minutes.

Side effects:

Day 1- felt fatigued that evening, not super bad but just wanted to nap off and on.
Day 2- the part I was worried about, flu like symptoms. I had a low grade fever and muscle aches. It definitely wasn't pleasant but it only lasted 6 hours and I was able to fall in and out of sleep. By 2pm my fever was gone and my body aches went down to a dull soreness. Still a bit sleepy and my arm hurt a 4/10. Took Tylenol and Advil and drank a LOT of Gatorade and was able to play Minecraft the rest of the day.
Day 3- all better!

The process was definitely way less scary than the months of anxiety I had leading up to it! The chances of having a severe reaction is literally one in a million and even if it happened all the staff are trained for that!

This post isn't to convince anyone to get their vaccines, just an in depth breakdown of what it was like if you're like me and don't find vague information helpful enough. Stay safe ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤",1
"Pentagon programs hope to make COVID-19 the last pandemic ever... US Defense Department DARPA using Active Program Management and Implant technology in it's war on pathogens.
Was the pandemic just a reason to mass test mRNA bio tech on humans?

With the recent pause on the J&amp;J vaccine b/c of some alarming incidents in 6 recipients, we shine a light on the fact that the 2 vaccines with the strongest efficacy and least complications to date, are of the new mRNA variety.  In my brief understanding, this is based on a new gene replication process for creating antibodies, never approved before for medical use by the FDA.  

What better way to run a massive test on the safety and effectiveness of a new vaccine technology than a pandemic to create the need for fast tracking new genetic medical tech like this?  Consider this new bio-tech and the ramifications of it's future potential.  Scientist's in the field are giddy about the ability to develop vaccines for future viruses in record times.  Developing a vaccine is now doable within 60 days of the first person to become sick according to DARPA.  That's a game changer and a huge money maker for any mRNA products that can now be developed without years of testing.  

It's almost like they knew they had the cure for the common cold all a long BUT they make so much money off treating it's symptoms, that it's doesn't make sense to cure it.  Now given this new tech big pharma can focus on new medicines using this tech rather than their old model of treating symptoms of ""incurable"" disease.

"9/10 searing pain in arm after covid vaccine
Never thought I'd say one of my most uncomfortable experiences in life is getting a vaccine. If had several vaccines before, all with minor side effects and a little soreness in the arm.

My options are take extra Tylenol, take some cocodamol, and there are a few codeine tablets left which I'm genuinely considering at this point.

"I was forced to get vaccinated by my parents for what purpose? Whatâ€™s the purpose of a vaccine if it doesnâ€™t prevent the virus itâ€™s supposed to protect you against?
My mom forced me to get the vaccine twice. Iâ€™m 17 and she believes that until I turn 18 she can do whatever she wants to me. Luckily, I didnâ€™t suffer any side effects.

I had the WORST migraine the day after that I literally had to take so many meds that I just slept the whole day. I can barely move or think and I've had to miss so much work because I literally can't function since then. My fever will break but then come back not long after it breaks. 

I've been alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol but it doesn't take my fever down at all. I've called my dr and they basically told me that I could go get a covid test but I don't really see the point in that as I have the vaccine and there isn't much anyone can do with my symptoms. I mostly just wanted to get a note in case work decides that they want documentation and it sounded like they just want me to go in. I don't think they understand that if I can't drive 30 mins for work I'm not going to be able to drive an hour to have a dr say ""yep you have a fever""

That is completely, totally incomparable to not wanting this novel mRNA substance injected in my own body.

More than 1 billion people on our planet have gotten the vaccine. The vast majority of us, are fine after it. Most of them just donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t use Reddit/ donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t see it as important news to tell everyone about it. And many (note; not all) stories of people not being fine after the vaccine arenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t proven to be tied to the vaccine at all. I mean, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve seen this post on a vaccine-sceptic forum saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœoh no 13% of pregnant women in the vaccine trials have had a miscarriage, the vaccine is making these women infertile panic panic panicÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, meanwhile 10-20% of all pregnancies end in a miscarriage. Vaccine or no vaccine.

I (20F, no AI disorders or any health issues, slightly underweight BMI but practically never get sick. Idk if this info is important but just in case) got my Pfizer vaccine the 6th of May, and had 0 side effects from it except from a slightly sore arm for 1,5 day. My period came right on time, not heavy or painful or anything different from usual. (IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve read some reports of women having cycle issues after the shot). My next shot is in 10 days. 

My mom (52F, blood pressure issues and meds), got the Astrazeneca first dose 3 weeks ago, and she experienced slight fever in the night and a sore arm. 
Nothing serious or lingering.

Some of my peers and many of my moms peers have gotten it as well, and are also doing just fine with no serious side effects.

I see lots of horror stories being shared, and the negative experiences need to be shared as well so that people can weigh the pros, cons, and the risks. But we also shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t forget that most people who had the vaccine and had a neutral/normal experience wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t tell Reddit all about it and just go on with their lives as usual. And that correlation doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t equal causation.

ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s the first time in history that millions, even a billion of people are getting vaccinated with the same vaccine around the same time.

Plus, donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t forget that now, because of ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœvaccine paranoiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, and the vaccine being brand new, people will write many unrelated things off to the vaccine. Like ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœoh IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m having a headache after the vaccineÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, meanwhile theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d probably have a headache either way because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re not drinking enough water/not sleeping well.

"Phizer Covid booster shots are already available in Bismarck for walk-in
If you're in the Bismarck area and want to get a Pfizer booster shot, Prairie SEA is already accepting walk-ins this afternoon and for Friday and Saturday afternoons too.  This is the clinic that I originally got my shots at, I timed them and they're so efficient that it took exactly 10 minutes from stepping off the elevator to sitting down for the observation period.  You can be in and out in half an hour.

"Anyone experience an auto immune flare after Covid vaccine?
A week after my first vaccine I am having a bad auto immune flare up. I have fibromyalgia and Ankylosing Spondylitis. I hurt from head to toe and have muscle weakness, going on fifth day. (I made an appointment for my doctor for next week, the earliest I can get in.) I had no problems the first week besides a sore arm. I am now in my second week post Moderna vaccine. I am willing to put up with a reaction if I know I have immunity and that this will go away. 

My daughter, who also has an auto immune disease, said she is hearing that people not on preventatives (immune suppression drugs) are occasionally experiencing flares. Has anyone experienced this?? I will discuss this with my doctor next week, but I am concerned about the second one being a worse reaction.

Anyone have a flare post-vaccine? Please no vaccine shaming.",0
"What video can I show my anti-vax sister to make the strongest case FOR the Covid Vax?
Okay, so, I'm pro-vax. Trying desperately to completely seperate myself from the anti-vax BS that my sister and I were raised on by our mother. My sister has yet to move on from it, however. After months of my sister spoon-feeding me horror stories of Covid vaccine-injured people, her making assumptions about statistics AND my mother getting angry at me over my pro-stance (enough to legitimately suggest kicking me out of the house I rent from her and living with my abusive father) - we've decided to agree on one last effort to show where we stand.

I'm not qualified to debunk that video above properly, any help with that would be great. 

I'm yet to find something strong enough that would convince her, or at the very least make the strongest point for it. Mostly just doctors stating what we already know (how it works, Covid is worse than the vax etc.), that won't work on her, unfortunately. The least 'simple' the better. I know there aren't as many long winded pro videos, simply because the pro side just gets on with their lives, while the anti-vax side feels the need to make the most noise. She mostly needs assurance of its safety.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Welp! I just got a positive COVID test.

We could have it so much worse. We could have this disease and be dying, we could be homeless, any number of things. But last year, with no hyperbole, was one of the worst years of my life and many other's lives. We both lost family and almost lost them, our mental health was destroyed, we were stuck in a mold filled house in the southern US, our health declining, because we were just trying to survive. We were poorer than I was in college and we are still paying off the debt of it. Not to mention everything politically that was happening that finally drove us out of the South. I don't want to do it again, I want this to fucking end.

"What's the argument against the COVID vaccine?
Apologies if this has already been explained. I did some light searching and couldn't find anything that had a consolidated argument against the vaccine. Obviously I've heard some things about it but nothing that was actually forceful enough.

Consider this a ""Change My View"" post. I'm someone who accepts the vaccine is safe and effective, but I'm not the kind of person who shies away from the truth or from dissenting opinions. If the data is valid then I'll change my opinion. I might not change my opinion right away, because large amounts of data will take time to pour over - especially if the sources are dubious - but it'll change regardless.

edit: i'm about to go to sleep so i won't be responding for a few hours, but let me give you my argument for why i took the vaccine, hopefully that will engender a response i'm looking for. basically it comes down to this:

1) i learned that mrna vaccines had been in development since the 90s

2) the vaccine is supposed to reduce spread, especially asymptomatic spread, thus making it easier to assess risk when socializing

3) the vaccine reduces the severity of infection meaning that if i do get sick, i'm less likely to die or be debilitated by it

if these are not true then it will destroy my faith in the vaccine. so that's the argument i'm looking for.",1

It began with voluntary self-limiting travel. Two weeks to flatten the curve/stop the spread. Then it was distancing, but mask if distancing was not feasible. Then it was mandatory masks. Then it was lockdowns. Then it was mandatory testing for schools and employers. Now we have shots that are voluntary but more and more employers, schools, and health care systems are toying with mandating. 

This is sick! Never in the history of the world were people mandated to take a medication to have a job or go to school or travel. Let alone a medication that the manufacturers have explicitly stated don't prevent, treat, cure, or mitigate spread of disease. Let alone a medication that the long term implications were unknown. 

""You don't have to take the shot but you don't have to work here either"" is COERCION. When all workplaces, schools, airlines, etc have mandates in place they DONT HAVE TO MAKE LAWS TO MAKE THE SHOTS MANDATORY. Just wait, jail time is next. They'll imprison people and physically force them if we let this continue.

"Your vaccine side effects are a milder version of what would have happened to you if you'd gotten covid unvaccinated
I just want to provide and alternate view to the one that says vaccine correlated adverse events or side effects are caused by the vaccines alone. The reactions that some people are having are in all likelihood the body's response to being exposed to aspects of the virus itself which the vaccines emulate.  In other words the people that are susceptible to adverse reactions to the vaccines are in all likelihood susceptible to far worse reactions from infection with the virus itself because the viral load is far higher in that case than the emulated viral load the vaccines provide.

So thank your lucky stars if you've had a vaccine, have had any kind of adverse reaction and are still alive because you in all likelihood would have experienced far worse consequences from becoming infected with covid-19 itself... and make no mistake everyone will become infected by covid-19 at some point because the vaccines don't prevent transmission.

If you happen to be one of the few who are susceptible to severe illness, your chances of survival or avoidance of permanent organ damage are far better if you've been vaccinated when you get covid-19 (and you won't know if you are one of the unlucky few until you get it).

Edit:  I think it's not possible to test this assertion experimentally because once you've had a vaccine you can't unhave it to see how you'd react to covid infection alone... but I think it's a pretty obvious conclusion given the symptoms are identical.  Vaccines save lives and prevent or reduce severe illness.  Taking a vaccine is  the lesser of 2 evils, the far greater evil being getting covid itself if you happen to be someone who is susceptible to severe illness or permanent organ damage from covid infection.",1
"I don't see any point in taking any Covid vaccine for myself to be honest.
I'm young and have very close to a 100% survival rate if I catch this virus. Covid is constantly mutating and makes older vaccines obsolete. People have caught the Corona virus even though they have been vaccinated. If I get the virus, I will just develope antibodies to it anyway and it will closer to the current strain in my area anyway.

The small risk of dying from one of these non FDA approved vaccines is just not worth it either. I shouldn't have to risk my life for herd immunity if people aren't going to do their part and be sanitary. I always wash my hands or use hand sanitizer before eating, and I don't let my coughs go uncovered, unlike many people.",-1
"Covid-19 Vaccine. Type 3 or 4 hypersensitivity
Good afternoon :)

Background:

I have had both covid-19 vaccines (Moderna). 
Im a 35 yr old female. Hx of pollen and mold allergies. Tx'd for allergies with immunotherapy, nasal steroids, and anti-histamines. No HX of anaphlyaxis. 
Otherwise healthy. 

My 1st dose: 2 weeks later 3 inch diameter erythemous itchy rash. Persisted for 4 days. Tx with 1% hydrocortisone. 

My second dose: 6 hours post-vacc 3 inch diameter erythemous rash, polyarthralgia, myalgia, and fever. 

Question: Based on the information provided would this be considered a type 3 Arthus (serum sickness) delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Or type 4 T-cell mediated delayed reaction?  I have seen studies indicate it could be either, but im leaning more towards the Arthus reaction.

"Covid vaccine, multiple autoimmune disorders, and allergies
I commented on one of the many Covid vaccine posts about getting the Pfizer vaccine because of comobidities. A background. I have Hashimotos and Graves - both diagnosed by biopsy rather than strictly labs. I no longer have my thyroid due to two thyroidectomies taking out each hemisphere. I do still have antibodies even though my surgeries were in 2004 and 2008. I also have Celiacs and Fibromyalgia. The medical community here has also thrown a possibility of yet more autoimmune disorders but nothing diagnosed yet. I do have allergies to most antibiotics but the kicker for me was that I had a reaction to the Anthrax vaccine that is given subcutaneous above the tricep. This vaccine didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t react the first 3 times out of a 6 shot series. Shot 4 was the one where the base here called it ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœlocalÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â reaction without ever seeing the site. The University of Kansas called it full arm involvement and then some which actually got it reported to the CDC. The local base wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t going to report anything. The reaction started at the tricep and had a half dollar sized involvment approximately 12 hours after injection then spread to engulf the entire arm from just below the wrist on my hand and all the way up my shoulder to include part of my collar bone area, breast, and shoulder blade - obviously not a local reaction. 

For the Covid vaccine, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve had any type of reaction to any injection, they will have you wait 30 minutes rather than 15 minutes for everyone else. I got to do this twice in a giant open area the VA has for staff and part of the Covid roundup theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re doing to vaccinate as many veterans as possible. No reaction at all for me but my doctors, both civilian and VA including 2 endos, 2 primary care, and my allergist, all agreed the best course of action was for me to load up on antihistamines (which I normally take daily at this higher dose) rather than discontinuing and following CDC posts regarding antihistamines and potentially masking anaphylaxis. 

For side effects. First shot just hurt for 12 hours but nothing compared to the TDAP pain. The second shot, which was administered on March 4th, made the arm hurt for 18 hours after. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s now a dull ache similar to working out. After the second shot there was a small 4 hour window of extreme tiredness and 2 hours of chills. Both of these happened about 18 hours after injection. Still didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t let the side effects stop me from my normal activities. I took kids to school, picked them up after sport practices, and cooked dinner.

"Received the first dose of the covid vaccine.

"Should I be vaccinated if I have had COVID-19?
Even if you have already had COVID-19, you should be vaccinated when it is offered to you. The protection that someone gains from having COVID-19 will vary from person to person, and we also donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t know how long natural immunity might last.

"Scleroderma (specifically morphea) and COVID-19 vaccine. Has anyone gotten one?
Wondering if anyone has gotten the vaccine yet, and if you've experienced any exacerbated symptoms! I have a friend with celiac, and she said hers didn't really provide any greater symptoms or flare-ups than normal.

Update: I received my first dose of Pfizer Friday, march 28th. A bit of soreness at site. Saturday was a migraine (hormonal influence for that as well), chills, a mild fever, and fatigue. Didn't notice any extraordinary joint or skin soreness. Slept 9 hours overnight and feel pretty good today so far (Sunday).",1
"Any articles about COVID-19 vaccines that proves they won't cause any bad outcomes in the future?
So I was talking with my friend and I really wanted to encourage him to get a shot, but he's really hesitant. Since I'm not really familiar with medicine or biology, I would happily read an article that proves the vaccines don't cause anything bad and I'll try to explain it to him. The main things he said was that vaccines fiddle with your immune system, something about that you will get easily sick or even in a severe form from a simple disease like a common cold. And also, since the vaccine is new, how can I assure my friend, that he won't get cancer or something similar in a few years or so? Thanks.",1
"Covid hell is a deadly slippery slope, my experience and advice to others
Dear Reddit India, 
The last few weeks have seen a flood of heartbreaking posts. The lucky ones among us are able to watch from afar because once you enter the pandemic officially, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s no going back. Only money, connections and sheer dumb luck will help some of you emerge alive at the end. Sharing my experience (it continues) in the hopes that everyone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s suffering knows there are others out there suffering with them, and as a deadly warning for everyone lucky enough to be safe still. What we read is just the tip of the hellish iceberg.

I (female,30) tested positive earlier in April. I ran a high fever and recovered in under a week. There were moments where I was scared but confident in my health and body that I would recover. And I did. And now I know IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m among the ones who were just incredibly bloody lucky to be alive. 

A week later my 91-year-old grandmother tested positive. She was asymptomatic. By the second day her fever rose. A good family doctor reassured us that her case was mild and she would pull through. We gave her fever medication and did all we could to keep her comfortable. By Day 4 her fever was still there and we were concerned. The doc ordered blood tests and a CT scan. Everything was clear. Her CT score was 5, and her oxygen levels close to 94. She was stable and healthy. Another doctor said sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll be fine too. Day 6 of her fever we rushed her to the emergency room of a major hospital. Her oxygen levels were at 95 and she was stable, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a calculated risk to keep her at home but she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t require hospitalisation said the doctors. They said space the fever medication and sponge her down. Day 7 we let the fever rise hoping it would break. By the 10th hour after she had taken her medication the fever hit 103 degrees. We immediately gave her meftal and she was better soon. The fever was gone. And then, hours later her oxygen started dropping.

We rushed to the ER the next morning. AGAIN, doctors said sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s stable with oxygen at 95 but said check with the OPD doctor. Two hours later OPD doc says sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s borderline, hospitalise her. But where. There were no beds. We headed home. By then we had started calling places for a bed. Her oxygen declined to 85 at home. A covid care hotel agreed to take her in and we headed there no matter the exorbitant cost. The doctor there put her on oxygen but said sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s too critical, take her elsewhere. They called an ambulance and we headed to the closest major hospital. A doctor at the ER there came out, glanced at my grandmother lying in the ambulance and said take her wherever you want thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s nothing here. We put her in the car and headed for home.

All this while I was dialling places frantically. A small medical facility got back to me. They had an oxygen bed but the doctor was clear that if she turned critical there would be nothing they could do about it. We rushed there and she was finally admitted, nearly 12 hours after we headed out in the morning. 

Very very hard lessons learned:
A) 1. The situation is completely helpless and a hundred times worse than everything youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve read. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s NOTHING out there. NOTHING. All there is the goodwill of some people who may call you back or answer your calls. 

2. MONEY. This will DRAIN your finances. EVERY. THING. COSTS. MONEY. You will lose money at EVERY STEP. And thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s no guarantee, NO guarantee that even all the money you spend will help maybe even 1 per cent. Beds, medicines, tests, ambulances and hospitals will cause you to bleed money:

3. HOSPITALISE EARLY. I CANNOT stress this enough. PLEASE HOSPITALISE ALL EARLY. Doctors donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to admit anyone who is just about okay. PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO THIS, HOSPITALISE EARLY. 
USE THE TIME THAT YOUR PATIENT IS STABLE AND STEADY TO FIND A BED. PLEASE PLEASE donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t make any assumptions, especially if the patient is even above 40. Please donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t depend on ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœhome remediesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœmanagingÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â it at home. PLEASE PLEASE donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t take such chances unless you are a qualified doctor. 

 4. PLEASE GET VACCINATED. PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS and all high risk people. Vaccination is going to be difficult in the coming days but please do it and stay safe, protect vulnerable people till you can get vaccinated.

B) 1. THE BASICS 
Look for non oxygen beds for mild cases and get reports such as blood tests, DDimer, CRP, ferritin, LDH.

2. CT scan is very important and please make it a point to get this by the 5th, earlier if your patient is not doing well. Hospitals, and any leads you follow will ask for basic information.

3. START EARLY. Leave for hospitals early in the day, 7am or so you get a head start and have the whole day to work on leads for a bed, tests etc. 

4. Maintain a database of all key numbers such as hospitals, ambulances, testing centres etc

5. Get tested at home if possible. Testing centres are a crowded mess

6. Spread the word aggressively that you need help. Ask. For. Help. We have only each other right now. 

7. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t move a patient until a bed can be confirmed. Things are erratic as hell and change by the minute

8. Proactively monitor oxygen levels and the temperature if your patient is at home or a basic facility. Press the panic button early in case of ANY DROP. 

9. Compulsorily have a thermometer and an oximeter and strips of dolo and meftal 500 at home. 

ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been a traumatic experience so far. I wish we had gotten my grandmother vaccinated early but we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to take her to crowded centre and expose her to the virus and end up in hospital. And IT STILL HAPPENED.  I wish we had gotten her admitted at the earliest. And I wish I had never gotten infected. But I did. And so many of us are even with everything weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re doing. My grandmotherÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s lungs are infected, we know where this is headed but itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s heartbreaking to be here. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re waiting for my motherÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s test and she is like to be positive too. The only consolation is that she was vaccinated a week before I tested positive.

MENTAL HEALTH
itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s difficult to even describe how hellish the last few days have been. And the worst is yet to come. I count myself lucky to have money, a home and food and a job. People are dying suffering in unimaginable ways, people with much less than I have. Experiencing this trauma and watching so many others suffer has been devastating. For me, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a 90 year old in hospital, for countless others itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s parents, breadwinners, the only hope living relativeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦.. the list goes on. Be kind to each other, thank the ones who are good to you, everyone is suffering in different ways, entire families have been devastated. Be kind, as much as you can. 

The worst is yet to come for me and my family. We will have difficult decisions to make in the days to come. But for now, as I try to make my exhausted mind rest, I hope and dream of a time when we will experience some happiness again. Take care everyone and stay safe.",1

"Period pain/symptoms WAY worse one week post-COVID vaccine #2
Hi y'all:

I'm 24, almost 25F, got my second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine #2 last Friday. For the past five or six days since then, the symptoms haven't been half as bad as it seemed like they might be, based on what others had said about the second dose feeling worse. So I went about my business, with finals all this past week, as usual except for emotional issues (PMDD), etc...until today. 

Period started today, and OMG I've felt like death all day. Exhausted (admittedly from fitful sleep interrupted by doorbells/noise outside), so dizzy/nauseous that I nearly passed out in the shower three times and had to sit down till I stabilized, pain so bad in lower back and other body parts that ibuprofen doesn't help, then more shakiness/dizziness/cold sweats later at dinnertime, etc.

"Covid Delta Variant, symptom changes, higher hospitalisation rate.
I think a lot of people are misreading where they say the symptoms are more like a regular flu and thinking it is the same level of danger as a regular flu.

Sadly, not the case.

Hospitalisation rates looks like they are higher than the Alpha variant. (Aka, regular garden variety Covid)

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext)

*""Risk of COVID-19 hospital admission was approximately doubled in those with the Delta VOC when compared to the Alpha VOC.""*

I also has a higher R rate, which is also bad, so spreads more easily.

Vaccine still looks effective vs it, dropping it's R value, and making it so people who have the vaccine also are far less likely to have trouble if they get it at all.

This is the variant which the traveller to Wellington is suspected to have, but he was also vaccinated, so is less likely to have transmitted it, compared to people who didn't get a vaccine.

As always, the Covid vaccine doesn't make everyone 100% immune, which shouldn't be a surprise, since that is what vaccines are like.",1

Thanks to my job, I became eligible last week and received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine yesterday morning.

"COVID deniers and vaccine doubters
We just got our first dose of the moderna vaccine. I've had people ask me if I'm sure I trust it. I'm like WTF are talking about? Of course I trust it. The likelihood of an adverse reaction is far far lower than the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID.

We have been isolating for over a year now and I'm so grateful that we were in a position where we could telework. But I am still the only one at my office who has isolated even though all have the option.

The isolation has taken a toll on our mental health and we have had to do it for over a year instead of 8 weeks because people are just selfish.

I don't get it why people refuse to get vaccinated.

These anti-vaxxers are putting a strain not just on healthcare, but also the economy. Also, why would people be discouraged by allergic reactions if data shows that it only happens to 1-2% per 1 million individuals who choose to get vaccinated. Lastly, if people are so afraid about getting allergic reactions, then shouldn't they make an effort to consult with a health-care professional if they're really doubting their eligibility. The government recently made an exception to those who truly aren't capable of receiving vaccines so there must be a way for them to figure it out.

Since Covid kills people, and because we know that the unvaccinated are particularly spreading the disease (and overburdening hospitals) , I believe it should be considered mandatory. 

There may be rare exceptions, such as when doctors (REAL doctors, not chiropractors or similar) state that a person is immunocompromised and should avoid the vaccine.

I do not believe there should be religious exceptions in the US for the Covid vaccine. It should be a requirement for being a resident. 

There is no rational reason why someone who could take the vaccine should refuse it. Yes, there are some mild side effects, but the effects of Covid are much worse.

I understand that there could be logistical challenges with forcing people to take the vaccine, and it could also spark an uprising. I don't think it's wise for our military to go door-to-door and hold people down.

""Well, thank you very much,"" I said, rubbing my hands. ""I didn't hear you say I should be taking it for the good of my health or anybody else's rather a return to normalcy. ""

**No response.**

This is the precedent set for the future. If the government shuts your business and stops you from working, the government no longer works for you. They're paying your wages. They own you.

You want your freedom back? We want your body, otherwise, you're a second class citizen. Forget the pub, travel!

Your neighbours, employers, friends and family will ridicule you for your views. Label you as a conspiracy theorist, an enemy of the state. These people are pre-programmed. They don't even know why they're taking the vaccine rather succumbed to state propaganda and carefully manufactured bile from the media.

I actually predicted back in April last year that this would be the endgame. Most of my family said they wouldn't take the vaccine if it becomes available. I was actually called a conspiracy theorist when I outlined in the pub just after the first lockdown ended in the UK that you will succumb to the vaccine due to propaganda and this ride is far from over. Of course, everybody was enjoying a pint after the first lockdown ended, the last thing they wanted to worry about was vaccines and passports and me spewing my conspirafacts. In fact, they thought it was finished, you know, that manufactured inch of freedom they trickled down to us in the summer. Clever uh.

I told them they would as their life would become extremely difficult if they do not comply. (My mother recently told me she's absolutely fed up and is now willing to take the vaccine literally so she can travel, pub and such. I know a lot of people with these mannerisms.)

We need to search passed the COVID matrix and what this government intrusion means for the future of our children. A precedent has been set. I would rather have more COVID death than grant our governments any more power. This is a war. We need to make sacrifices.",-1

"1st post here. PLEASE don't judge. Are YOU taking the covid-19 vaccine?
 

(sorry for any english mistakes)

In MY opinion, covid is real, not a hoax at all, BUT, it was clearly lab-made, and there's simply no study or article showing me wrong. Even if there are, i simply wouldn't believe it, because im sure the results would be bias. On top of that, this is very abstract and subjetive. Scientists can say x and show x, but we, society, will never ever even see x with our own eyes, meaning that the result could very well be manipulated.

With that out of hand, in my country (Brazil) people are starting to get vaccinated, and as a messy country as it is, the goverment is buying different vaccines from different brands: oxford, china, brazil itself, jhonson &amp; jhonson, pfizer, moderna, and most importantly, the russian vaccine, SPUTINIK V.

History has previously shown us throughthout the time that vaccines can't possibly be made in that short of a time, not necessarily because of scients, technology etc, but because of testing. How could you possibly vaccinate the whole world, with a substance we (society) don't know and that hasn't been tested massively yet? What if, in 2 years of taking it, the human body starts developing some sort of condition because of it?

I'm not presuming anything, like i said, this is just a question. This whole pandemic situation just makes me so unconfortable. The rich got richer, and the poor has never been poorest.

It's crazy to think that, we watch the news and the ""media"" everyday and hear them saying that ""2.000 people died in the past 24h of covid in brazil"", yet we simply continue with our lives like it's nothing. I'm not here being a anti-vax karen bitch, please, that's not the point, i'm just really, really scare about everything that is going on right now.

So, are you taking it? I simply don't trust the elite, the media, the rich and the goverment anymore.",-1

"True or False? - ""There are currently no fully FDA-approved licensed COVID shots available. All COVID shots remain under federal Emergency Use Authorization, meaning individuals have the â€œoption to accept or refuseâ€ the product.""
It seems very confusing to me... if there are truly no fully FDA-approved licensed COVID shots available, and the jabs remains under the EUA law and thus people have the â€œoption to accept or refuseâ€ them, why isn't this option being used en-mass?    

For example, why can't the Southwest pilots who don't want the jab refer to ([https://lc.org/newsroom/details/100821-no-fdaapproved-covid19-shots-available](https://lc.org/newsroom/details/100821-no-fdaapproved-covid19-shots-available)) that states there are currently no fully FDA-approved licensed COVID shots available and therefore they have the â€œoption to accept or **refuse**â€ them.

Hello!  If you're vaccinated and realize that the concept of forcing it on  people is insane, please speak up! The situation is beyond dire. We  are  careening into the stuff of nightmares.

â€œ  Martin NiemÃ¶ller (1892â€“1984) was a prominent Lutheran pastor in   Germany. He emerged as an outspoken public foe of Adolf Hitler and spent   the last seven years of Nazi rule in concentration camps. He is  perhaps  best remembered for his postwar words,

First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak outâ€”because I was not a socialist.

"It's time to make the covid vaccine mandatory in the US.
This isn't a game anymore. Many people have died and will continue to die because of people's stupidity and arrogance. People not getting vaccinated would be fine if it only hurt them but it puts everyone at risk especially due to mutations and new variants. I'm usually for personal freedom. For example I'm pro choice when it comes to abortion and birth control. However I'm also anti gun rights. 

Most doctors require children get a myriad of vaccines in their youth. Most health care professionals are required to get vaccines. Most schools require children to be vaccinated. Many companies require people to be vaccinated. When you travel to or from certain areas or certain countries you have to get vaccinated. This was all the case long before covid. We don't let people walk around completely nude in the general public. We don't let everyone make bombs for fun. There are lines we have to draw as a society and being unvaccinated against covid crosses it. (obviously if you have a valid medical reason that's different). 

If we can enforce the above rules and previously enforced fines for people that don't have health insurance then we can enforce this. Yes people will try to fake it, fine them like Canada just did some tourists for $20,000. Medical staff that are found to help fake databases for people will be fined and subject to criminal penalties as well. 

If everyone had worn masks in public and stayed home as much as possible with or without lock downs maybe this wouldn't have been necessary. If we were at 90%+ vaccination rates instead of 50% maybe things would be different. Before anyone says anything I recognize the issue with the lock downs were that the government didn't pay people enough to stay home. Everyone should have been given something like $2000-$5000 a month for the duration of lockdowns as long as it took. In fact this should be a thing permanently but universal basic income is a topic for another post.",1
"Anti-Vaxxers and Covid Deniers are some of the dumbest people
I REALLY need to vent because this is really getting on my nerves. People who deny the existence of Covid, or for whatever reason don't believe it's that bad and won't get vaccinated, are burdens on society. I just don't understand HOW someone can look at the numbers, look at the data, and still not want to put in the zero effort to wear a piece of fucking cloth on their face for 10 minutes to walk into a store. It's so FUCKING annoying. I've listened to the CDC and their guidances, and I've been fully vaccinated for about a month now, but it all feels in vein. I no longer wear a mask unless I have to since the CDC says full-vaccinated individuals can forego masks (except in certain cases like public transportation and local business policies). However, some idiots are taking it as if they have an excuse now to not wear a mask. My mom, who I love with all my heart, is victim to Facebook's ""they're putting microchips in the vaccines, you're just a lab rat"" type shit. Or like, in my History class a few days ago a classmate of mine said that we can't trust the people who made the vaccines since we don't know what they put in them. And in the nicest way possible I was like ""Well, the ingredients for the three main vaccines are listed on the CDC's website."" And she was like ""How do you know they're not lying? Were you there when they made it?"" HOLY SHIT! These people want to be smarter than others and special SO BAD! Was I there? No. Do I still question what I'm told? Yes. Does that mean I'm gonna give in to these dumbass conspiracy theories that vaccines prevent you from having children or something? HELL NO! Half a million deaths and counting from this illness, and people STILL don't take it seriously. ""You know you're basically a lab rat and the vaccines haven't been approved by the FDA, right?"" Firstly, they have, at least partially. And secondly, if being a lab rat means we can get back to normal and prevent any more people from dying, I'm ok with that. ""But they have microchips in them that track you."" Motherfucker, you have a phone, right? They're already tracking you, and that's been PROVEN (thanks Edward Snowden). So what difference does it make? ""But they give you Autism/AIDS/Turn you Gay."" They don't give you Autism, the study in the 90s that claimed that has been debunked hundreds of times, and the majority of scientists who worked on it refuted their own statements years later. And as someone on the Autism spectrum, I find it disgusting saying you'd rather risk your child's well-being than have an autistic child. They don't give you AIDS/HIV and don't contain Mercury, Embryos, or anything like that. The mercury they USED to use was very small and couldn't hurt you, and no, they don't have embryos or live viruses that can hurt you. And ""Turn you gay""? Seriously? It's 2021, grow the fuck up and log off of Facebook once in a while. Once again, as someone who isn't completely straight, it's insulting that people would rather possibly die than be ""turned"" gay.

I'm just fearful of what the future has in store, and I don't want people to die. But these anti-vax, Facebook-dwelling, idiots value themselves so highly that they can't see how their actions affect others.

I had my first Pfizer dose in late May, experienced a small flareup of symptoms 4-5 days after the shot (mucus, small amounts of blood, a little diarrhea and urgency). The symptoms tapered off by themselves and vastly improved after my monthly Entyvio infusion.

Due to my experience, my GI recommended I try Moderna for my 2nd shot. Had it 7/17 and got the usual fever/chills &amp; sore arm. Today (7/19) as my fever breaks, I find I have a large amount of blood and mucus in my stool.

5 Reasons to get the Covid 19 vaccine-

One, if you get infected with the virus, it will go all over your body and stay there for at least a week and be much more likely to cause you long-term problems than the vaccine. 
Two, if you get the vaccine, it will prime your immune system, but then the vaccine is gone. It will not be with you anymore. 
Three, more than 95% of the doctors who have been offered this vaccine have gotten it as soon as they can. 
 Four, the more we vaccinate, the faster we can get back to growing our economy and getting jobs. 
 And five, if people get vaccinated, we're going to save at least 100,000 lives of Americans who would  otherwise be killed by COVID.",1

"CMV: High Covid cases aren’t as big problem a problem as people are making it out to be
So for reference, I’m talking about the U.K. here, as that’s where I’m from and where I live. 

In the past few days, I’ve seen many people wanting “Plan B” for as Covid cases are rising. But, deaths and hospitalisations are relatively low compared to how it was last year, before the vaccine

If you look at the numbers and compare with last year November when things were getting bad. Today there were 36,567 cases with 38 deaths. That’s a 0.1% of deaths.

On the 25th November 2020, there were 15,871 new cases and 474 new deaths. You can already see the difference, and as a percentage that’s 3%. There’s a massive difference between 0.1% and 3%. 

Even when you look at the 7 day averages you see the same trend. The current 7 day trend is an average of 46,358 cases and 136 deaths, which is 0.3 %. Last year end of November it was 15, 970 and 486 deaths, which is again 3%. 

Furthermore, the age group with the highest amount of cases is those in year 7 - 11 (roughly aged 11 - 16), and those of that age group aren’t at a very high risk. And also in a few weeks numbers will further decrease as now school children over the age of 12 are now getting vaccinated.

"COVID-19 Vaccine and C. Difficile recurrence.
I'll try to keep this short:

- I have Ulcerative Colitis and have been on Entyvio to maintain remission for several years.
- Earlier this year, for the first time, I tested positive for c. difficile. I also had a UC flare at the same time, probably as a result of the infection. I took Flagyl, and then Vancomycin. I also took Florastor and haven't stopped taking it. 
- 2 weeks ago I took my first covid vaccine shot (pfizer). 
- I didn't feel much of anything during the day, but later that night, I woke up with abdominal pain, gas etc.
- From that point, I slid day by day into to what seemed like a UC flare, and then shortly after, it was obvious it was a c diff infection as the kind of bleeding I get from that is different from UC. (nose bleed coloring the entire toilet bowl red, vs maroon mucous).

My doctor told me that he rarely sees people solve their c diff infections after a single treatment of antibiotics. More common after the 2nd pulsed treatment of vancomycin.

Anyway, I'm putting this out there in case someone else has the same experience. No, its not proof that the vaccine causes anything, it's just my anecdote. I have absolutely no idea if the shot aggravated my immune system and gave the dormant c diff spores a chance to thrive again, or if it was just coincidence. 

Make of it what you will!",0
"COVID LH &amp; Pfizer
Scheduled myself for the booster this week but getting anxious. I feel like I had more severe symptoms than other people I know. I contribute that to having had COVID to some degree. Chest pain with sinus tachycardia. EKG was abnormal, troponin levels came back good, X-ray showed no inflammation. I had chest pain, rib pain, and my heart was beating like crazy. I’m extremely anxious about getting the booster, but also anxious about the alternative since getting COVID again also scares me. I read out there that the vaccine helped a lot of long haulers, did it help any of you? I actually started to feel like some of my symptoms (not all mind you) were resolving. Then it felt like they got worse again after getting the 2nd dose. 
Anyhow any long haulers get the booster yet? Any issues with your heart such as myocarditis? Waiting to try and talk to my doctor for her recommendation. I was hesitant for the same reasons after the 1st dose &amp; my dr. said I was fine to get the 2nd. I drove home after the first and felt dizzy &amp; light headed on the drive home along with a fluttering feeling in my chest and later that night soreness in my chest that scared me because it felt too similar to when I had COVID. Went to the ER after the 2nd. Not sure what my doctor will recommend since myocarditis is now a noted symptom that was not back when I first got Pfizer. Any advice? Anyone experience anything similar?",0
"If you won't get the covid-19 vaccine you can't have any sort of modern medicine. Go back to leeches.
If you doubt the science and Lord Fauci about the efficacy of the vaccine or it's safety then you unironically aren't allowed to use any modern medicine. It's an all or nothing deal. You don't have the freedom to pick and choose parts of it you like. Only our government approved science priests do.

So wow. Just been vaccinated under group 3. Got a text message 2 weeks ago to book and it was really easy. Arrived just before 8am at the  one in Elliot street in Auckland city. I was second there so basically we went right in, waited like 2 min and was vaccinated.

"Second Pfizer COVID vaccine in first trimester
Hello! I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine before my pregnancy and aside from a long night's sleep and a sore arm, I was fine. I just recieved my second dose today at 9w+6 pregnant and I'm aware that there is a slightly increased risk of experiencing side effects this time.

I thought about taking acetaminophen tonight before bed just in case I develop a fever overnight, but my doctor said it wasn't necessary as acetaminophen may not be as harmless as previously thought. So I'm wondering what the science says, if anything.",0
"“It only works if everyone does it”
That’s called a CRAPPY VACCINE. 

Normal vaccines are supposed to protect YOU. To PREVENT YOU from getting sick, period. They don’t depend on who around you has or has not received the shot. 

It blows my mind that people are so stupid that they don’t even question why a vaccine suddenly works only in large numbers when that’s never been the case before. 

If you’re vaccinated against anything and are still told to worry about other people infecting you, the vaccine is trash and people need to run in the opposite direction. It’s NOT HARD TO GRASP.",-1
"Covid jab
I had my first jab (pfizer, iirc) a couple of months ago. A couple of months ago I was doing pretty good, walking a bunch, diet was good, pain controlled, hell, even the weather was good. I got the jab and I was a victim for a full week; my arm felt it had been run over by a truck and I just felt *meh,* kinda run down, when other people have just had a sore arm for a day or two and that's it.

I have an appointment for Jab the Second on Friday, but I'm currently on a low ebb, with a fresh diagnosis, but no treatment,  (awaiting further tests) of anemia. This has me feeling *meh* to begin with, barely able to get out of bed, light headed, and weak.

Healthy diet (Mediterranean) and daily physical activity.
No prescription medications but relies heavily on daily antihistamines.
No medical conditions
Lawyer (so exposed to some occupational stress)

Concern: headaches located at the top of his skull, that spread to the sides of his head. 

We had our first shot of Pfizer on the 9th of Sep. Roughly 2-3 days later, he had a migraine, which he has not had before. Although he did suffer from stomach migraines as a child/teen (diagnosed) and his sister, mum abs grandad suffer migraines. It lasted around 4 days but was mild, in that he could work and function but he was dizzy, sensitive to light and tired.

As of the last week and a half, he has been waking up with headaches that range from 3-4/10 on a pain scale and are gone after 10-minutes of being awake. This has happened in the past (waking up with a headache that disappears shortly after waking) but not this consistently. 

My questions are:
Could this be related to the vaccine?

Could this be related to sinus? He suffers terribly from it and itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s spring here in Aus at the moment and we are surrounded by cherry blossom-lined streets.

Could this be related to the oral gear he wears for teeth grinding? He started wearing is as of one month ago and I have heard him snore louder than before (he usually doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t snore) when wearing it. 

Should we seek medical care/imaging?

 A friend of his jumps on my post and states I can get reinfected. So I respond with a web link I have that list only 66 confirmed reinfections in the world an how I monitor it weekly and the number barely moves.

She responds back that the Vaxx is the only way we reach Herd Immunity ðŸ˜ƒ . Well well well.I respond back letting her know that it should be common knowledge by now that the Vaxx doesn't prevent you from catching covid and she should read the trial data as it is confirmed in the trails you can still get covid19 after the Vaxx.

My doctor advised me to get the vaccine, but I know the majority of pregnant people in this country have been choosing to wait. I work as a teacher and am on summer break now, but I feel like the amount of stress I was feeling at work being unvaccinated means itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s better to get it and be fully vaccinated by the end of the first month of the school year.

"What was your immediate thoughts/ feelings when you heard the vaccine was becoming a reality? I think they announced it 2 weeks before it was released if I remember correctly.
I was scared and horrified. I didn't even know the details about it yet. The topic of medical rights and vaccines have been on my radar for quite some time. My first thought was ""Is this going to be forced?""

It seemed like the rest of the world only cared about whether it would be FREE. I knew that it would be, not only FREE, but also incentivized because of what I seen with the flu shots.

Then people started getting it and info started coming out on it. We seen what happened to Tiffany Dover. I didn't know what to believe, because we didn't know at that time that the vaccines were, in fact, killing people. Then rogue doctors started speaking out, stories shared of family members and friends declining physically &amp; mentally and some dying. 

I guess I could say I'm informed on the counterargument for vaccines in general. AKA ""anti-vax"". That's what stopped me initially from running out and getting it before finding out about all the nastiness.

I'm just curious how the people who aren't anti-vax knew to avoid this before the horror stories became available? Was it because it was rushed &amp; experimental?

Note: I can't remember where I heard this, but supposedly Fauci wanted the flu shot to be the big, universal shot everyone got. But the fear wasn't strong enough, and the flu shot isn't very effective. Not that the Covid one is effective, but they did have the fear element.",-1
"You aren't an anti-masker or anti-vaxxer, you are an anti-dictatorship, you're anti-authoritarian, anti-oppression of our freedoms &amp; rights
The fight for our freedoms is effecting the lives of people that are complicit to the deterioration of our freedoms. These people just want to get on with their lives, many don't see that they are being oppressed from all the illusions the media does with holding up a lie with how we live. People increasingly are being forced to get vaccinated and those that fight for our freedoms are labeled as anti-vaxxers.  Freedom isn't free, we fight for it with our lives, with our wallets, and with our reputation. In this unique time utilizing our freedoms puts others at risk and the general population doesn't care that our freedoms are being taken away and now we see how much they don't care about being oppressed with a giant flashlight.

I'm saddened to learn there are people that understand freedoms are being taken away but choose to be sheep. And use derogatory terms pushed by the media to tell others to get the vaccine and just be oppressed. In the short term the vaccine may save lives now (in theory) but in the long term it may kill more lives as we will be forced to take experimental drugs or vaccines without our consent which is not new to human history.

A person that chooses to be a sheep is far worse than a person that doesn't know they are a sheep. I was once a sheep, a sheep can be taught the truth. Anyone that quits/loses their job for refusing to get vaccinated gets the utmost respect from me.

I got a third shot and don't regret it (I am in perfect health, not immunocompromised).  Pfizer is like 40% efficacy for delta variant (infection) and I don't want to be infected.

This is totally anecdotal, but I got my booster at 7+6 and was just worried bc little babe is/was so small but I decided to get it because my doctor recommended it, it was available, and I'm all for protecting me and the babe - I think we can all be a little tough on ourselves when we are in charge of growing a human (like, I will normally take advil/tylenol all the time, but when pregnant I have to force myself to take 1 Tylenol when I'm in so much pain with a headache).  I went in for an extra ultrasound today because I'm a nervous Nelly and everything was beautiful at 9+5 - I'm even measuring a day ahead! So if you are wondering if it will negatively affect your baby or cause something sinister, I'm just a little 2 week test case that it's all good after the booster! 

Also for what it's worth, with my second shot I had a little fever, body aches and was down for the count for a day or two, and with the booster I just had a bit of a sore throat for a day or two - no fever or chills or anything.

I was planning to get a COVID vaccine in the near future but now IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m unsure because there have been deadly side effects reported like blood clots, inflammation of the heart, etc. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m worried that I might die from it. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want my parents to see me experience the suffering. Looking at recent statistics, it looks like it might be mandatory to get a vaccine so my fears of succumbing to a COVID vaccine might be coming true.",-1

"I have natural immunity, I don’t need a vaccine? Leave me alone? Why can’t I get a natural immunity card?
Why can’t I get a natural immunity card? Why would that not be an option?

I’m under the impression that different vaccines use  very different mechanisms? Im assuming there must be some difference in effectiveness then? So where does natural immunity fall on that spectrum?

Vaccine is just psychological leverage to make society binary.",-1
"Anyone from Indonesia? mandatory vaccine?

"Losing Period After 2nd Dose of Covid Vaccine
Hey everyone,

Yesterday, I got my second dose of the covid vaccine and I started feeling some of the side effects that same night. Body aches, chills, and a really bad headache. I induced my period a few days before by taking Progesterone (my OBGYN tells me to do this every month) and it just stopped all of a sudden. Usually, my period would last closer to six days so itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a bit concerning for me. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m optimistic that this is just a short term side effect too, but I would love to hear if this happened to anyone else who got the vaccine.

TIA

update: ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a month later and I got my period, so I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t have too many concerns anymore :)",0
"Anyone had problems after their Covid vaccination?
Had my Phizer jab a few weeks ago and was progressing linearly as the program suggests i will until i had this jab, no signs of slowing or stalling. But ever since i have been working at 80-85% of what i was, my energy levels seem to have plummeted.

The only way i can describe it is if you try to lift after not eating 8-10 hours before lifting your body just feels achey and exhausted. Nothing else in my life/routine has changed, as the weeks go by the degree is lessening but its still frustrating when you are chasing a squatand deadlift goal and get set back.

Anyone else had these issues?",0
"Covid Vaccine
Hello, don't want to make this controversial or anything. But did you hear or read articles or maybe experience yourself penis growth from the vaccine? Is this true or just propagand? Thought it could be an interesting topic. Also sorry if this has been posted before...",0
"DC Covid team - slow? Inefficient?
Hi everybody, good morning and happy Saturday

So, long story short, a few days ago my wife and I tested positive for Covid-19. Even fully vaxxed, it’s really unpleasant.

I’ve been trying to do what (I think) the civically responsible thing is and let DC Health know. 

I called the number and they said a contact trace team member would call me back. They never did. I tried do it through my iPhone too, but it requires a code from DC Health, which never comes.

What do I do here? I know I’m not required to, but for the sake of accurate record keeping alone I’d like to let DC Health know.

Any suggestions?

PS - please take care. If this is how I feel fully vaxxed, as a healthy and active person, I can’t imagine how bad it must get",0
"CMV: If others around me refuse to get the COVID vaccine, and I can get a third and fourth dose / there's an oversupply because people refuse to get it themselves, I should.
I live in a part of the United States where the number of unvaccinated people is very high. I received my first and second covid shots back in March and April.

Research shows that a third shot / booster has a strong protective effect for people who have already been vaccinated. There is already discussion of approving booster shots for healthy people, and immunocompromised and healthy people are already receiving third shots in other countries.

Given the number of unvaccinated people in my area, and the rise of the Delta variant, I fear for my health. Therefore, to protect myself against the unvaccinated, If I am able, I should get another round of the COVID vaccination.",1
"Got the call! Getting the Covid vaccine this week at DeVos Center. What was your experience there?
I was surprised to get a call on Sunday but am really happy to get the vaccine. I hope itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not a hassle parking and standing in line but it will be worth it. Hoping everybody who wants a vaccine can get one soon.

*** edited to say. Went this morning and it was a well oiled machine. The lines moved fast, so organized, and the volunteers were awesome ***",1
"MMW In less then a year, mental health services will be overrun by people who advocated against the COVID vaccine.
As loved their ones die and the reality begins to settle in that most of these deaths were preventable, COVID vaccine critics will begin to breakdown mentally. While the pain of acknowledging the responsibility of directing those who eventually passed to not get vaccinated will be lost on many, those willing to look at their own behavior will suffer.

Not only those who directed loved ones to skip the vaccine, but those who spread misinformation about the severity of COVID will also begin to understand the harm that they caused and begin to show signs of mental health concerns.",1
"I dont want to get the covid vaccine
Tomorrow im getting vaccinated and im so fuxking anxious about it because i feel like im gonna get fucked by all the side effects. Idk my body is a mess and if im really scared of both needles and injecting shit inside me. If this vaccine had been around for longer i would feel safer. I also hate the fact that i will need two doses so its not even done after the first dose.

Edit: i got vaccinated",0
