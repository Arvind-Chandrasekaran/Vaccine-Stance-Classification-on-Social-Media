"Covid vaccine question
A few weeks ago i got my first shot of pfizer and before getting jabbed the doctor asked if i plan on having kids, iÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m just curious as to why heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s ask that, does it mayhaps have a link to infertility?",0
"Good pfizer experiences, covid survivors, 26F, 27M
So to start off I am terrified of needles and after reading all the possible side effects and different experiences I was pretty anxious about getting my vaccine. Plus I already had Covid back in October and I was worried that I would have a stronger reaction to it

First shot: my arm hurt like hell and I felt like I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t really sleep because of it or move it very much. The next day about, 24 hours later, I started feeling kind of dizzy and tired and out of it but that only lasted for a few hours. Arm felt totally normal in about two or three days.

Second shot: arm hurt a lot less and the actual shot was administered a lot better. Felt a tiny bit sore/achy/tired the next morning but I also stayed up late working on a project so could have been from that. Honestly wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t have noticed if I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t looking for any symptoms. Arm stopped bothering me after I used it a bit (by late morning it was totally fine)

My boyfriend had covid at the same time I did and had the same experience with the vaccine (also got pfizer)",0
"How was your experience with the second shot if you had covid and a bad reaction to the first?
Obviously everyone is different but apparently if you had covid the first shot could be bad which is was for me. I had a fever and aches and pains for 2 nights. First night it was pretty hot My bedroom but I was shivering. Second night I woke up drenched in sweat. all while feeling achy and exhausted. Thankfully that next morning I woke up pretty much fine.  Pretty much exactly how I felt with covid but thankfully a shorter timeframe. 

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m really just wondering how people in similar situations reacted to the second shot? I need to mentally prepare myself for it if itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s basically the same. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll definitely be taking off work too. Or could we only be so lucky that the reaction ends up not being as bad.",0
"COVID-21 will happen this year. People will start getting sick at the end of the year and this will be called COVID-21 in 2022. The numbers will be over 10x worse than what was reported for COVID-19.
All the vaccinated are affected right now.  Their immune systems are permanently and intentionally damaged as planned.  The experimental 'vaccines' are about creating another pandemic that Will further push more 'Vaccine' demand and Vaccination Passports for everyone.

They do not care about people's lives.  You are considered livestock and product to them.

Can you argue that they are wrong when millions of Humans line up to be euthanized by next year or so?  Line up like cattle to the slaughter.",-1
"Eye Floaters after Pfizer COVID vaccine
Has anyone else noticed an increase in eye floaters and hazy vision after the Pfizer COVID vaccine? Other than seasonal eye allergies, I do not have issues with my eyes. About a month after my 2nd vaccine, my eye started burning, watering excessively, redness and dryness, floaters, and hazy white areas. The symptoms transitioned to my other eye. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve seen my eye doctor 3 times and everything appears to be great (he did a macular scan to check the overall eye health). Oddly, I found this article which seems to mail what IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been experiencing. I wanted to ask if anyone else is experiencing something similar.

"If you don't believe in Covid or its treatments then you're a fucking idiot who deserves to get it.
Throw away account for obvious reasons so please, spread your stupidity to the comments section I'm just going to ignore it anyway!

I have to live with anti vax people and I hear a lot of stupid fucking things that they fully believe in despite absolutely no sound proof or scientific findings. It boggles my mind at how people can be lead on this easily. 

To start with covid, guess what, it fucking exists. And guess what? It is dangerous. 

""Oh it's just the flu"" 

Yes, its base symptoms are identical to that of the flu. But that's not all it does, it makes later or even present issues so much worse. This is common knowledge. 

""It was created by whoever for whatever"" 

This one always makes me laugh, for a few reasons. First, it was a scam to get Rump out of office. Well, he's out and guess what? It's still fucking here you God damn idiots. 

While I personally lack the proper understanding to post directly how it was made, man made or natural in the end it wasn't a ploy by the government, you're just paranoid or want some form of an excuse to go against the government so you can feel like a wittle badass in an uprising while you're too unhealthy to run a mile without passing out!
(The ending was a personal one for me) 

""The vaccine was made too quickly! It messes your DNA! It has 5g data!"" 

First off, to people who came here to hear my rant, I wish this was a joke. People actually believe this. First off, making the vaccine as quickly as people did is is nothing short of a miracle.again referencing the fact that I don't fully understand the science, since I'm not a doctor or medical professional, I do trust what they have to say:
mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine. They don't use live virus to trigger an immune response. Instead, they teach your cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response. Once triggered, your body makes antibodies. These antibodies help you fight the infection if the real virus does enter your body in the future.

It doesn't alter your DNA so just stop. 

My favourite one, and again I'm not joking people actually believe this, that the vaccine is affected by 5g signals and that's why it can make you magnetic. 
To better explain, check this link posted by McGill University
https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/covid-19/can-vaccines-make-our-body-magnetic

It's actually kinda funny. 

""Well horse dewormer-"" 

No. Just...no. yes, a variation of the drug can be used by humans to treat parasitic infections but why in the fuck would you take a medicatjon that 1. Isn't prescribed to you and 2. That has no actual proof through the FDA that it cures Covid? 

Fuck if it did it'd be a lot easier don't you think? 

""Oh well they just don't want us to get back to normal"" 

Are you fucking stupid? Well, yes probably, but I'll tell you something special.

EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS GOING THROUGH THIS!

I mean shit we can't even get along on a regular basis do you honestly think that every country, every enemy or rival or whatever you want to ca it country has the capability to get along and agree to say 
"" You know what's a great idea? To mimic a bond movie and just fuck the entire world up while we all sit in a vault and laugh"" 

You can't be this stupid. (For ref, believe me or not I don't care, I've traveled across the other side of the world and they have the exact same regulations there as they do in the west!)

People with compeltly different political, religious and general beliefs are suddenly getting along to fuck with us? Yeah, I'll put tinfoil on the shopping list. 

Let's see, what else. 

Oh yeah. 

If you're curious about Covid or its treatment and want to make a claim about it then do exactly this:

1. Go to your local doctor and ask.

2. In the extreamly unlikely event that they state the vaccine is fake or whatevermake sure they have viable proof, confirmed by other accredited doctors who actually attended medical school.

3. Record their statements, documents, etc and post this online. 

Oh and lastly, if you're worried about the CO2 from your mouth going back into your nose or whatever, heh then you don't want to know how much CO2 is in the air we breathe. 
Plus, doctors have been wearing surgical masks for decades. Now, I know you're not as smart as a doctor but I'm sure you can play pretend since you have such a strong belief that they're out to get you. 

Fuck I hate people.

Oh and a remidner if you want to go ahead and spout whatever bullshit as a response to this please! Feel free! I read this shit with my wife and friends and we get a laugh over all the stupid people in the world!
(Bonus points if you smoke because I'm 100000% positive you can't list all 700 chemicals that go to making a cigarette)

I haven't even touched on the statistics or anything with the virus and to anyone who wants to say 
""It's such a risk! My grandma's aunts, cousins sister 8 times removed got I'll from the vaccine!""

Yeah, no shit. A vaccine will always have negative affects and people who respond in an extreamly negative way.  But I'ma let you in on a secret...

The chances of dying from the vaccine is roughly 1 in 1,000,000

Chance did dying from lighting, in US, 1 in 138,000

"Got (long) covid after vaccine?
I got vaccinated and afterwards got covid pneumonia, haven’t been able to return to sports for three months now… Colleague of mine also got sick end of august, after his vaccine and he has the exact same thing? Someone else had this?",0
"Speed of covid vaccine is very unusual. How come
Covid vaccine has been created in record time. No vaccine before could ever be done so fast. It took years at minimum.  WHO said at start of pandemic, it will take at least 18 months at fastest.

So I'm wondering if safety measures and steps were skipped to create it fast? It seems to be done in a haste.  

Is that why they don't know how much longer than 6 months can it last?

I'm also concerned that the hastily prepared vaccines may have long term side effects or complications that are unknown as of now.

The speed of the vaccine is the reason I refuse to get vaccinated as of now. I want to wait and see what happens after an year.",-1

That made me quite scared about the second dose, which I got yesterday at 9 AM EST. Went out drinking with my friends after, woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine with just a slightly sore arm. Had some nausea too but a little pepto bismol instantly got rid of that. Point is- if you had a bad first dose experience and are afraid of getting the second one- donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be !

"Itâ€™s only downhill from here
When covid started slowing down and the vaccines became available for people I honestly thought it was over. During that time everyone was under the impression the vaccine protected against covid and would stop the spread.

Thankfully, I never got the jab. Now with all this back and forth information that dosent make any sense on why we should even get poked in the first place or how the unvaccinated could possibly be putting the vaccinated at risk if the vaccinated can still easily get and transmit covid.

I truly thing we are on the edge of something massive. They are going to mandate vaccines, you can see it with the amount of crap the news is putting out on unvaccinated people. Slandering them and saying itâ€™s their fault for covid still existing. 

Workplaces are started segregation of vaccinated and unvaccinated. Some countries (France) are making it mandatory already.

Her employer is mandating vaccination by October and her customers (hospital health systems) are also requiring all vendors be vaccinated unless medical reasons prevent. How do we find a doctor in Michigan that will help this new breast feeding mama keep her job and sanity? Family doc and OB both said they would not support her efforts to put off the shot since there are no known issues regarding breastfeeding or future pregnancy at this time.",-1

However, it was just put out that whoever does not have the vaccine by September 10th or documented proof they are in the works of getting it will be terminated. 

I think my best bet will be to let them fire me for the unemployment benefits.

"CMV: people refusing the covid vaccine will be the target of the next genocide
First of all, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m a conspiracy theorist. Lets get that out of the way. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not a doom and gloom conspiracy theorist. When my mind travels to the depths of Q level conspiracies, I can typically rationalize myself. Thats becoming difficult for me now, so IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m coming to yÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™all to help rationalize me. 

I believe that people who choose not to get vaccinated will be the target of the next genocide. 

It wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be as simple as people think. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re not gonna round up antivaxers and throw them in concentration camps. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re simply gonna mandate the vaccine to do anything in public. Then they can slowly but surely throw all the people who refuse the vaccine in jail with the rest of the criminals. 

Normally, when I get to this point, I remind myself that the vast majority of people are good, and would see the horror in this and protest side by side with the unvaccinated. But the MSM propaganda is actually overwhelming, to the point that I believe people will see this genocide happening, and say ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœwell they chose not to get vaccinated. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s their stupid choice and the human race is better off without their genes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â 

Covid is real, the vaccine is safe. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not denying either of those things. But to act like someone is the scum of the earth because they donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t understand the science and simply want to wait a bit, well, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s about where weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re at in society. I believe covid was invented in a lab, and the plan from the beginning was to kill off the population that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t blindly accept the propaganda the media pushes. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve kept that belief to myself for the longest time, because I know IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m a conspiracy theorist and itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s my paranoia talking. But the more I see the media dehumanize anyone refusing the vaccine, the more concerned I am that this fear is very real. 

To summarize, I think people refusing the jab will start facing charges for their choice. With an unvaccinated population in jail, covid will wipe out most people who reject elitist propaganda. The normal people who IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d hope would have our backs if it got to that point, are being convinced that our lives donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t matter. Once the deaths start mounting up, people will say we chose that fate, and deserved it. 

Please, snap me back to reality",1
"Australian National Review - The New mRNA COVID Vaccines Inject an Operating System into Your Body â€“ Not a Conspiracy Theory, Moderna Admits It
The mRNA â€œvaccineâ€ (gene therapy) literally hijacks your genetic machinery. They tell us itâ€™s to produce spike proteins (which cause blood clots) of SARS-CoV-2 which stimulates an immune response and is obviously is working so well.

Never in the history of the United States has there been such a ravage of our medical autonomy. The entire world is losing their shit.

I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve read about Graphene Oxide before, but there was a â€œconspiracyâ€ going around that it (GO) makes up a big portion of the vaccine solution. Itâ€™s funny because when Pfizer released the ingredients, the 3rd ingredient listed was redacted upon its publication. I believe they were sued or something? But they later revised the ingredient list and said it was â€œwaterâ€. Why in the hell would you redact water on an ingredient list??

Graphene Oxide nano particles are capable of creating formations when EMF waves are introduced. Itâ€™s no coincidence to me that the 5G rollout was ushered in literally right before the pandemic and is now rampant everywhere. There already has been research into using Graphene Oxide in vaccines. It also has bio-sensing capabilities and can facilitate cell growth.

Of course this is all â€œspeculationâ€. Some people may think Iâ€™m crazy or a â€œconspiracy theoristâ€, but what I do know is that the future is going to get real ugly, real soon.

I'm a 20 year old male from the UK. I hesitated slightly in getting the vaccine because of the talk of blood clots and I wanted more safety information. Young people also are not at much risk at all.

As time has gone on, the idea of vaccine passports has started to materialise and I've become more resistant to getting vaccinated. I could get it tomorrow and all of my worries and fears about being checked when I go on holiday or losing my job would go away. But then who speaks for the people who can't get the vaccine or otherwise just don't want it?

So, to all those pushing these authoritarian measures and checks, well done! You've actually just made me more hesitant. At this rate I'll probably wait until December to get the vaccine out of protest, or I won't get it at all if things get worse.

"What are your thoughts on the covid vaccine?
I've had my first jab, getting my second done. Honestly I see bad with the vaccine and without it catching covid. Monkeys in the SARS cov 1 trials, were fine until they had their second vaccine, but when they caught covid, they had something called anti body dependent enhancement. Which killed even the healthy monkeys who if they hadn't had the jab, wouldn't have died. And if you look on the gov site, this vaccine hasn't been fully rolled out until 2024. 

So the only real concern I have, is if there is a delay with anti body dependant enhancement. Don't get me wrong I'm no scientist. There have been people getting blood clots after the Pfizer as well. This vaccine passport roll out in the UK, I feel is an invasion of human rights. If people want to risk catching covid by not having the vaccine and going clubbing, let them do so. It's their choice. 

But Borris saying you can't enter unless you have both, I personally think it's forceful and disgusting. Some people don't want to risk their lives. It is still in experimental faze. I've had mine because, even though the death rates on covid is only 1%, that is still enough people to populate entire countries. And 1 out of 10 people (I worked it out to be 1 out of 4 going by the other fact of, half of the survives), but apparently 1 out of 10 people that catch covid develop something called long covid, which can lead to things like stroke, heart attack, and even brain damage. And people report (covid brain) quite often, which is where people literally can't talk they slur for weeks after covid.

So my choice because covid is rife in hospitals with mainly people without the jab at the moment, dying according to Dr's I follow online, I would rather have the vaccines, especially because I am not the healthiest person. I'm not severely unhealthy but I am unhealthy. So what are you deciding? Any opinion is welcome",1

My first jab didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t give me any side effects, so I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t worried about this one. Woke up today feeling like IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been hit by a semi.

"Male, 33. Elevated heart rate following Covid vaccine - is it myocarditis?
I received a second dose of the Moderna vaccine on July 7th. I woke up the next day with expected symptoms (soreness, fatigue, fever), though as well noticed my heart was beating quickly, and I could feel a bit of tightness and achiness in my chest, but nothing too severe. Initially I wasn't concerned.

Currently I'm at 12 days post injection. The tightness and achiness has improved, but my resting heart rate remains elevated. My normal resting heart rate is in the low 70s/high 60s. Following the vaccine, it's in the high 80s or 90s. My blood pressure is fine. I'm not really sure what to do at this point. I don't have the full range of myocarditis symptoms (I'm not breathless, physical discomfort in the chest is minimal), but am now starting to wonder whether this will resolve on its own. Any input would be very much appreciated.",0
"Arm weakness after first dose of COVID vaccine
Apologies if this isn't allowed, I haven't posted here before.

I got my first dose of Pfizer about 3 hours ago and my arm has felt somewhat weak since - not severe enough that it's collapsing under any weight or anything like that, but it definitely feels off, and at times my fingertips feel slightly numb.

This isn't listed as a side effect on the paperwork, and the only things I can find about it online talk about it starting \~6 days after the vaccine, not within hours.

Just curious if anyone else experienced this, has heard about it, was warned about it etc (and whether I should be concerned immediately or let it run for a while lol)",0

"Finally received my 2nd COVID dose (very delayed though). Had heart palpitations 1st dose.
For my first Covid shot (Pfizer), I initially had fatigue, headache, and chills. Later, I developed heart palpitations that was difficult  to deal with, because each episode would incapacitate me. It eventually went away. I contemplated for a long time about the 2nd shot, but eventually took it earlier this week. I am glad to say that the symptoms are more mild than my initial dose. I still dealt with fatigue, headache, and chills but they were more mild and easily managed with acetaminophen. The symptoms disappeared by the 2nd day and arm soreness is nearly nonexistent. The arm soreness lasted for more than a week to 2 weeks for initial time and it was hard to sleep on the side with that arm. 

I am describing my 2nd dose experience, because I hope it gives people a bit of hope. Also, I want to add the reason I finally decided to take the 2nd shot (albeit very delayed). Despite being worried and anticipating worse side effects for the 2nd dose, I still felt it was important to completely vaccinate. If I already felt badly for the first shot, I can only imagine how sick I can get with the actual virus. I rather not be in a hospital or be struggling to breathe every breath. The virus is capable of multiplying in the body while immune system struggles to fight the virus off. In the meanwhile, the lungs can become impacted and filled with fluid. COVID can easily make you succumb with pneumonia. To have pneumonia is exhausting for the body and anxiety-inducing because the person is struggling to breathe. The mRNA vaccines only tells the body to make a protein that the COVID-19 virus uses to penetrate and attack our cells. The mRNA is self-limited and does not replicate itself, but the actual virus can. And, it can wreak havoc on the body before the immune system build its own antibodies to fight back. It takes at least a week for the human body to make specific antibodies to the virus. Although there is the innate immune system, the body need the antibodies to fight it off effectively. In the meantime, the virus can cause the person to develop pneumonia or breathing problems to the point that he/she needs a ventilator. What if the ventilator is not enough and the person needs ECMO? There is not many ECMO machines in the state and even taking the drastic measure does not guarantee recovery.

Just something to think about. 
Overall, COVID-19 can cause lung complications and other things. The vaccine gives a chance for the body to recognize it before you face the actual virus. When you do, it does not need a week or more to build the specific antibodies to fight it off. 

Also, there is data to show that can reduce transmission. Any percentage to reduce spreading to others is also helping your family, friends, or people that you give a care for.

I wish everyone well.",1
"Could the COVID vaccine have caused my chronÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s?
Let me start by saying IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not a scientist and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m certainly not anti-vax, but something recently occurred to me.  Four months ago I got my second Covid shot, and within one week I began developing severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, and this continued over the subsequent months, worsening and eventually I experienced rapid weight loss and a perianal fistula which I now need surgery for.  I had a colonoscopy on Monday and was diagnosed with CrohnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s disease after it showed ulcerations in my colon.  

Before the vaccine I had no symptoms of chronÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s disease, although I did have the odd stomach cramp here and there.  I was a smoker for the better part of 20 years (I recently quit) and was on doxycycline for a decade so I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be surprised if those variables had something to do with developing CD, but did the vaccine trigger it?  Is there any evidence to support this theory?  It seems highly coincidental that my first crohnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s flare occurred within one week of taking the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t mean this to be an anti-vaccine rant so please donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t take it that way.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a legitimate inquiry",0
"Got my 2nd COVID shot the other day, but it's really just a letdown.
I am thrilled to be fully vaccinated, I've been looking forward to this for a long time. There are a few reasons I've been looking forward to it, but the main reason was to make it safe to visit my grandma again. She unfortunately passed away April 12th. She was staying in a co-op home which seemed to be really good for her, but they've locked down really hard (which I understand), and living in a colder climate has made visiting outside for the last few months not possible. The nurses have set up some video chats for us, but I hadn't been able to see her since the end of last summer, or give her a hug since before this all started. I really was just hoping she would be able to make it through until it was safe to see her like before, but that just wasn't the way it was meant to be. When she was put on hospice I was able to see her with a mask on, and scratch her head for her when it was itchy. She'd cognitively declined, but she told a few good jokes and we got to tell each other we loved each other.  


My grandma was like another parent to me and did a lot to help raise me, and I'm going to miss her terribly. I don't mean to sound selfish, like I just wanted her to make it through this for my sake, I really hoped she could make it through so she could be happier. I am someone who believes in and afterlife and that I'll see her again, but it still hurts. And while I can breathe some relief having the 2nd shot, it's just not all it could be with my grandma gone.",1

"ADE and sudden death among the vaccinated this winter will be the covid narrative's saving grace
Most people are beginning to realise the vaccines do not work, even the most pro-vax people are beginning to come to this conclusion. Plus the FDA are ""hesitant"" about releasing boosters quoting safety concerns as the reason, causing even more confusion and scepticism. Some people even believe we will be returning to normal soon and are hence bored of the covid show.

In a couple of months time, if the ADE rumours are true, hundreds of thousands if not millions will die or become gravely ill from vaccine side effects. But this of course will be reported as a new strain of covid originating from the unvaccinated, ramping up the fear once more which will make people think boosters are the only solution.

When people really start seeing people dropping down in the streets out of nowhere, this will give the covid narrative a new breath of life and will restart the covid narrative once more.

He had a rough 8-9 days but came out on the other side of it. No big lasting effects despite obesity and high blood pressure. He had an asthma attack during the worst of his Covid (he was asthmatic as a kid but not as as adult).

He cleared his quarantine and following CDC guidelines, got his second Pfizer as scheduled this past Friday. 

Friday night had no side effects.

Saturday was fatigue (but less than with the first shot), and gradually worsening body aches and headaches. He ended up with a 100.3 fever as well. Took some ibuprofen and felt totally normal.

Sunday, lessening body aches and just a sore arm.

Monday, totally normal.

Did some research to rebut a friend's post that ""all of the Covid deaths are in vaccinated people""..   Here's what I found:

I see so many different opinions online about it. Of course many pregnant women here saying they got it and everything went well along with info that the vaccine doesn't even cross the placenta. That made me feel a bit more at ease. But then I see another side of negative opinions on it on articles. Talking about hidden miscarriages and so on. And then my father telling me i shouldn't take the vaccine. So, so far I've been having such a hard time to make up my mind on it.  Despite already setting up an appointment at walgreen to get my first pfizer dose at 15 weeks. I want to know if I'm really doing the right thing. I do want to protect both myself and my baby. I won't see my OB til I'm almost 17 weeks. This is my first pregnancy as well. And I know the impacts of covid during pregnancy and how there's no way I will want it even in my third trimester. But want to make sure I'm making the right choice in getting the vaccine and that maybe the negative comments on the vaccine during pregnancy is just a misunderstanding on their part or spread lies. Also if my post comes of as offensive, I do not mean to and I just am a bit scared on my choices during pregnancy. Its a hard one. Of course if this post needs to be taken down, then I will understand.

UPDATE: I know now I'm making the right choice in getting the vaccine. Thank you everyone for your support and advice on letting me know I'm making the right decision. I also apologize about this post. I know I could've posted this with better words. But thanks again everyone.",1

ive had health anxiety since i was like 12/13. im 22 now. and actually, my health anxiety kinda started BECAUSE of a shot. i got a shot(forgot what for) at 12/13 yrs old and i got side effects and I started googling and anxiously thinking so many things and it started an ongoing cycle of health anxiety since then. so to be able to get fully vaccinated, getting not just 1 shot but 2 shots, is amazing. im so proud of myself. im proud that i was able to go and get a shot that won't only protect me but protect people who aren't able to get one and our elders. if you have gotten the vaccine, im so so proud of you. or even if you're still struggling to go get yours, im still so proud of you for actually wanting to get it!! you can do it. as the guy at the vaccine place said, ""covid sucks!"" that got the whole line laughing ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â˜Ã‚Â‚ we'll get through this!!!ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â’Ã‚Â•ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â’Ã‚Â•ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â’Ã‚Â•",1

"Never seen anything like this vaccine extremism
I don't ask anyone if they have taken the vaccine. I would never dream of prying into someone's medical history unannounced. This is akin to walking up to someone and asking if they've had a vasectomy or any surgeries. If they haven't, great, it's somebody I know I can have a beer with. If they have, also great, it's also somebody I could have a beer with. Maybe there's just one topic we shouldn't talk about, no big deal.

But not them. I just joined a subreddit dedicated to a TV show. There was a person on the show who had been prescribed gabapentin for depression. Gabapentin is not an anti depressant and ironically causes suicidal thoughts - this is written in bold on the drug. So I said some doctors were dumb. Coming from me, having been disabled by a doctor's malpractice at 31, this is a very reasonable thing to say.

And then within an hour somebody had clicked on my name, went through my post history, and replied not about the TV show but with ""anti vaxxer"" accusations. These people have taken the fun out of life. We had a TV show we liked in common, but he just had to pry. When I clicked on his profile his avatar is a dude with a pink goatee, so I'm not entirely surprised.

My family is fighting daily amongst each other with the family medical professional pushing everyone else on how ""safe and effective"" it is and somebody else mulling over the decision every second of every day. This person keeps reminding me all the reasons they don't want to take it until I've finally said several times ""then don't take it, but shut the hell up about it already""

What is this all about? Is it just really nosy people who want to impose compliance? Or is it all an attempt to humblebragging what a hero they are because by virtue of their insults, they're announcing they are vaccinated?",-1

"COVID-19 vaccine side effect: possible nerve damage
Hello! My mother recently received her second dose of the Moderna vaccine around 8 days ago and for the first day, she felt the common symptoms (general fatigue, soreness), but on the second day she noticed that her left arm (the one she received both doses in) was unable to move freely. She has difficulty gripping objects and moving her arm, along with pain in that arm. She describes the feeling in her arm as the same feeling when you hit your funny bone. Her doctor referred her to a nerve specialist in regards to possible nerve damage. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any possible explanations as to what caused this? She believes that the person who administered the second dose to her jabbed her too low in the arm.",0

"Nursing home with near unbearable covid regulations
My grandmother recently moved to live closer to us. The nursing home, when we toured it in April, had no covid regulations and masks were compulsory. When we moved her in around May, that had completely changed. 

Not only were they requiring masks, but they checked temperature too. And the women at the front desk were total Karens. I didn't mind at first, I felt kind of bamboozled, but it's a nursing home. More strict regulations are understandable. 

Well, those feelings changed when they implemented the ""kiosks.""

"COVID Funk - Yep, We Are There
[Axios 09/03/2021 -  America's in a COVID funk](https://www.axios.com/americas-in-a-covid-funk-c6167b08-914c-46b8-8316-b140a8791d85.html)

Good Article (and short) -  ***The pandemic may not be over, but Americans are over the pandemic ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” and it's starting to show in our collective willingness to cooperate with public health guidance.*** 

Every time I see or read something about how bad our pandemic is this year compared to last year - there is one thing that these reports seem to miss - We were still pretty much closed down last year compared to this year.  

Once the vaccines were introduced, many vaccination groups stepped up to get theirs and then in May  2021, the CDC seemed to give a pretty hefty all clear and many began to go about much of their normal life regardless of the CDC caveats issued as a memo to the all clear.  I think many people are just disregarding these cautions.

I know that many states are struggling to get their vaccination rates UP by whatever means that seem to work and they keep trying.  But I also look at some of the states that did really well early on (GOOD JOB!) but since then their rates have barely moved the needle.  So we will probably get to some measure of a % of vaccination and maybe booster(s)  at some interval and that will be about it.  Not too much different than our annual flu vaccine rate either.

Face it people, we aren't too much for the collective good when it comes to the health of all - we aren't too good at having restrictions placed upon us even if it is for the common good - we aren't too good at taking care of our own health either even if it is just an injection.  But on the other hand, if it is some kind of pill that touts it will take care of what ails us - so we don't have to exert any effort - we seem to be all in -

"How does the vaccine protect you more than if you had Covid and got over it?
I  can understand the political agenda of favoring vaccination over just  getting it and and your body fighting it off, what I don't understand is  how a vaccination gives you a stronger ""immunity"" than the later.

A  vaccination is usually explained as giving your body a sterile form of  the virus, so it can learn from it. It seems this is exactly the same as  just having the virus, and your body eliminating it.

How is someone who has taken the vaccine more immune to Covid than someone who has got the virus and recovered from it?

"Covid vaccine - second dose - Moderna - my experience
RA background: 

diagnosed in 2019, have only been actively treating with sulfasalazine DR 1000mg two times per day. Not super effective so I will be adding Humira soon. 


Vaccine background:

I received the Moderna vaccine yesterday at 2 PM, unfortunately outside of the 28 day window because of poor scheduling on the clinics part (scheduled me on day 3 of the 4 day grace period, which goes against CDC guidance) and then bad weather. So I was vaccinated on day 35. 

Vaccine issues:

I had no immediate issues. Soreness at the injection started by 10pm same day. About this time, my husband who also received the shot started experiencing chills, but not too bad and also so pain at the injection site. 
Around 5 AM the next day (this morning), my husband had pretty bad chills and a low grade fever. My injection site pain was pretty bad but not unbearable. 
By 10AM, my husband still had a bit of a fever. I had a low grade fever as well but didn't know it until I tested the thermometer on myself. 
By noon, I was in full-RA flare up. Every joint from my neck to hips feels locked up and inflamed. I can't lift my 18lb son at all because of the back pain. I plan on spending the rest of the day laying on a heating bad. I'll add edits if things change.

"Partner tested positive, Advice?
So my partner has tested positive 5 days ago and he’s been doing ok to be considered. He said it feels like a bad flu. 

But the main thing bothering him is a very consistent cough that is getting worse. He explains it as a ticklish feeling in the back of his throat that won’t go away and coughing fits when he first wakes up then coughing throughout the day, which is hurting his throat. 

I have asked him if he feels pressure in his chest, fast heart rate or trouble breathing and he says no. It’s just this cough and feeling drained.

He isn’t vaxxed and doesn’t plan to be (until more research is done on it as a bare minimum) However I am of course concerned about the possibility of this cough worsening into the horror stories I’ve heard ? I am a worrier but trying not to over panic, I can’t post on other subs asking for insight as I have been banned for being a member here (I support the freedom of choice)

"IMHO, between thrombocytopenia and blood clots the COVID vaccines are targeting platelets. A setup for the true kill shot: A Marburg viral outbreak.
There is an epidemic of blood clotting breaking out among the vaccines all over the world. 

I have a theory that even those who are not outright dying are having [their immune systems](https://theexpose.uk/2021/10/15/its-worse-than-we-thought-fully-covid-vaccinated-ade/) and their platelet levels weakened all as a setup for something truly horrific.

This is very unusual for me, as my cycles are fairly regular and last 28 days with a 13 day LP.

A much more toned-down version of a rant I posted earlier.

This whole situation has been going on for what, 18 months now? I see lots of posts in this sub about protests and such, but then I leave my home and see the reality here in America. On the TV, internet and radio - advertisements for vaccines. Billboards and signs telling me to take the jab. People everywhere voluntarily masking. I'm surrounded by people who eat up every word spoken by the CDC.

I'm fortunate that my father thinks just like me, so I have that bit of sanity in the world, but even with that, I just don't know how to handle this much longer. I used to be incredibly kind, going out of my way to help people. Now, I don't do so because so many people would turn on me just because the government told them to do so.

How do you all handle this? How do you live in a world that thinks you're insane, and a growing number of people view you as the enemy? I know these people aren't my enemy, the corporations and government are, but that doesn't help when Mask Karen^TM is screaming at me, or Jab Nazi keeps asking me for my ~~papers~~ vaccination card.

When I had Covid the first time, it hit me hard. I had fevers up to 103.5 for 10 days. I had Covid pneumonia and was coughing up blood. I would start coughing and literally could not stop to catch my breath. 

This time is different. My children got it from their babysitter that tested positive. They just had runny nose and sneezing. My daughter kept testing negative on rapid and pcr test.  

A few days ago I developed a scratchy throat, sneezing, and slightly runny nose. I thought well I guess I have the cold now. It seems like allergies or a cold. No fever. This time is totally different than the first time I had Covid.

"Do you have any insights on managing COVID-19 vaccine side effects?
I'm  a female, 24 years old, and I'm 5'2"". I expect to get a strong immune  system response. I am aware a lot of the vaccines cause side effects  like tiredness, migraines/headaches, muscle pain, and my friend who is  also a young female got chills from the Moderna one. There is also  physical symptoms sometimes like COVID arm (redness/rash).

The  reason why I am asking is that I live at home with my parents who are  anti-vax. I plan getting the vaccine behind their backs. I am worried my  parents will confuse the side effects for COVID-19 and panic. If they  figure out that I got vaccinated, I'll just have to deal with the  consequences. Part of my plan to get vaccinated is to mask/lie/cover-up  the side effects and any evidence of a vaccine as much as possible. My  plan so far is to have tylenol and/or ibuprofen on hand for the side  effects.

2021-09-02: My wife comes into my office to tell me she got a negative result. I check my email and find out that I have a positive result.

2021-09-03: Up all night with horrible headache. Fatigue sets in and headache gets so bad that I am bed ridden.

2021-09-04: Headache subsides. Still fatigued, sleep most of the day.

2021-09-05: Mild cough. No headache. Energy levels back to normal.

2021-09-06: I take QuikVue at-home otc covid test and get a positive result. Wife tests herself; negative. Wife tests both of our children; both negative.  


Both of my kids go to public school and my wife is a public school teacher. I work from home and don't go anywhere (dev life haha). My guess is that one of my kids caught the virus from someone at school, was asymptomatic, and spread it to me but they are no longer carrying it. I find it crazy that my family was able to stay covid free until november of last year, but this year I caught it within a few weeks of school starting back up (kids went back 8/15). My kids are wearing masks but most kids at their schools are not wearing masks. When I get my son at dismissal, no one is social distancing. They will block up the side walk and I have to walk out into the street to walk around the clusters of people.

TL;DR - if you are vaccinated and have had the virus already: wear a mask and keep physical distance in public, and get tested as soon as you as you have symptoms. If you have not been vaccinated - GET VACCINATED. Please. Please. Please.",1

"There are absolutely zero legitimate reasons why any healthy adult should not get a vaccine. COVID or otherwise.
The only people who should not be getting vaccinated are people who have health issues that could be compromised by the vaccine which is an infinitesimally small percentage of the population. Everyone else needs to get it. No excuses.

The anti-vaxxers are especially problematic because they are actively trying to frame the pro-vaccine people as these belligerent, freedom hating tyrants when in reality it's the other way around. Projection and nothing more. Those people who scream about freedom when being asked to wear a mask know nothing of the word, and are simply belligerent children who don't like being told what do.

I've also noticed that people who refuse the COVID vaccine don't actually have any reason as to why they won't take it, and as a result they give these long, convoluted and drawn out explanations as to why they won't get it. When in reality the reason is, ""I just don't want it."" Which is not a legitimate reason. Either that, or they huff and puff away from the conversation, angry that you used facts, logic and their own words against them. These people don't want to have a conversation and no amounts of facts and logic are going to change their minds. They want to have their beliefs reaffirmed by likeminded people, and then they get angry and play the victim when they aren't.

Here are some examples I heard personally, this is going to come across as extremely condescending so bear with me, but I think it illustrates the point quite well.

* ""Well it's a personal choice."" Nope. Insufficient answer. Get the vaccine.
* ""There hasn't been enough research."" Nope. Insufficient answer. There has been plenty of research over months of clinical trials and thousands of volunteers with little to no ill effects. Plus half of the country has gotten it and there have been what? 100 cases of side effects out of 160 million people? The evidence does not support your reasoning. Get the vaccine.
* ""1 to 2 percent death rate."" Nope. Insufficient answer. COVID might not kill you personally but it's not exactly pleasant. Even peak human beings like Jayson Tatum have gone on record as saying it really screwed them up. Even if it won't kill you personally, you could infect someone who could die from it. Or you could get a more severe case since you're not vaccinated. You've also demonstrated that you're not a gambler. Talking about the 1 to 2 percent death rate but you're betting on the 0.0025 percent chance that you're going to have detrimental effects from the vaccine. FOH. Get the vaccine.
* ""I'm worried about my reproductive system."" Nope. Insufficient answer. People who parrot this are likely getting it from a Facebook story that said vaccines caused birth defects in the 50's and 60's. Now I know the occurrences they are referring to and they were not caused by vaccines but by Thalidomide pills instead. You were tricked. Get the vaccine.
* ""What am I not entitled to my opinion?"" You're entitled to your opinion which is wrong but so is everyone else. You're not the only one with an opinion and people who say this expose themselves as self centered since they seem to think that their opinion matters more than that of others, or that it's a special opinion because it's contrarian. Wrong. Not unique, just wrong. Get the vaccine.

These people also try so hard to make themselves out like some kind of martyr. Like they're fighting a good fight. But they're not heroes, they're not martyrs, they're not being ""cancelled"" they're not victims and they're certainly not fighting a good fight. They're on the wrong side of history and will be remembered as such. There are so many more visceral and insulting things I want to say but I'm worried about violating rule 2.

The news media is also not doing a good job of covering the issue. Giving both sides equal time when they absolutely shouldn't. They should be pro-vaxx and pro-vaxx alone. While shitting on anti-vaxxers and their rhetoric with extreme vitriol. Treating them like the jokes they are.

TL;DR: Anti-Vaxxers are not victims with a different opinion, they are either bad faith actors or gleefully uninformed.",1

"Covid vaccine - 1 short pfizer - endo-pain, am I alone?
I need to ask. Googling just gives me a lot on endo and covid, nothing om the vaccine.

Its going to be a bit of a longer post, just to explain. But it all cooks down to the question ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â«Am I alone in having endo-problems side effects after the vaccine?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â» 

I know there is still no ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â«side effectÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â» recognized from taking the vaccine, on periods and stuff. But enough women around the world have repporten enough on it that I feel there must be some corrolation.

I have taken 1 dose of pfizer. 2 weeks after getting it I woke up at night from cramps. Its 1 weeks later, and I still have cramps. They have upped in pain, from 3/3,5 to a 4. Not the biggest change, but still noticeble. However from monday this week painkillers have not really worked.

My normal cycle: I can go 4-5 months before cramps start. The crams are not constant, and only happens when I do physical work (running, stressing at work, loads of stairs, working out etc). At 5-6 months I start to spot, also with physical labour. And closer to 6 months the spoting and crams happen with even just lying on the sofa. So I usually take a pill break anywhere between 4-6 months, timing it so I get it at the start of a weekend, and I can stay at home and relax. My pain is not as bad on the pill, as it is with no hormonal treatment. And normal painkillers work.

This time, its only been 2 months since I had my last break, and 2 weeks after the vaccine this happens. I just know it must be from the vaccine. That is the only thing that can explain this sudden change. Given how many other women do repport on period problems after the vaccine.

I am planning to take a break next week (need to time it right for work), and I am very afraid that this will be as bad as it is off the pill. I have morphine laced painkillers, so I am ready for the pain, but I am also really dreading it ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â˜Ã‚Â°

"Religious exemptions from Covid-19 vaccines is immoral and demonstrates how religions harm others (including children) and society.
Claiming a religious exemption to not be vaccinated demonstrates a lack of concern for other people and is immoral and harms society. Do unto others as you would have others do unto you ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” manifests that concern for the well-being of others is at the core of morality. Those who choose not to take the vaccine ignore this concern and therefore act immorally. But the U.S. allows people to use this ""belief"" to exempt themselves and people, including children are harmed.

Children with  COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are about 21% of all cases. About 88,500 new pediatric COVID-19 cases were reported according to the [latest weekly report](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/) from the AAP and ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Hospital Association. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 3.63 million children have tested positive, making up about 13.6% of all cases. At least 297 children have died of COVID-19, about 0.06% of all deaths

ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœAn estimated 2,600 Los Angeles Police Department employees are citing religious objections to try to get out of the required COVID-19 vaccination. In Washington state, thousands of state workers are seeking similar exemptions. In Arkansas, a hospital has been swamped with so many such requests from employees that it is apparently calling their bluff.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â [https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-religion-los-angeles-arkansas-3ba53f2f00e1ab7105d7d128f2b1e65d](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-religion-los-angeles-arkansas-3ba53f2f00e1ab7105d7d128f2b1e65d)

Religious objections, once used sparingly around the country to get exempted from various required vaccines, are becoming a much more widely used loophole against the COVID-19 shot. Even though few organized religions have taken theological stands against vaccination, employees still can usually claim a religious exemption based on their beliefs that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t have to follow an organized religion.

Laws that require vaccination are the epitome of a neutral law of general applicability: a requirement that applies to everyone and that was not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion. Even if this were not so, the government can infringe on religious freedom if its action is necessary to achieve a compelling interest.

Stopping the spread of a deadly communicable disease is obviously a compelling interest and vaccinations are the best way to reach that goal. No one, in practicing his or her religion, has a constitutional right to endanger others and shows how religion can harm society.",1
"Why I will never trust any government or company ever again &amp; growth in harsh times
Last year made us realize that all the so-called ""conspiracies"" came true. In fact, the agenda behind the current ""COVID-19"" policy goes even further than we even estimated beforehand. It means to me that I have not only become a libertarian (whereby I reject all possible authority and do not consider it as authority), but also only regard myself as ""authority"" when it comes to: **1) my body, 2) my life , 3) my future.**                                                                                                                                                                                                         **Not even one politician, expert, scientist or otherwise will be allowed to determine or direct my way of life.** I don't allow that. I am done. In fact, this pandemic has brought about something very essential and fruitful: it has increased my independence and appreciation for autonomy and I will never, ever, ever, ever again rely on the authorities and be dependent on them regarding making healthcare choices (for example) any longer. It is over. 27 years old, or rather, 27 years young and I've chosen to live independently for my entire lifetime. And my self-esteem, self-confidence and compassion to myself and others have never been this high before, because of this era. So, frankly, all their efforts backfired! I feel more confident and determined than I've been in all previous years. So everything they wanted to achieve through this (an acquiescent population that obeys and accepts tyrannical laws and dictates from the government willingly and meekly and a population of low spiritual energy) has not come true, at least not for me and - if I estimate correctly - the same applies to this entire group of 100,000 like-minded people. To all governments I would gladly say; *unfortunately to you, you have awakened us for life, so that didn't go well, did it?

Being fully vaccinated reduces odds of long-term Covid-19 symptoms by half, UK study suggests

""We found that the odds of having symptoms for 28 days or more after post-vaccination infection were approximately halved by having two vaccine doses. This result suggests that the risk of long COVID is reduced in individuals who have received double vaccination, when additionally considering the already documented reduced risk of infection overall"" researchers wrote in the study published on Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

The data included more than 1.2 million adults who reported receiving a first dose of vaccine, and among them, 0.5%, or 6030, tested positive for a breakthrough coronavirus infection after receiving that first dose. Among nearly 1 million adults who reported receiving a second dose of vaccine, only 0.2% or 2370 tested positive after completing both doses.

Some groups were more vulnerable to breakthrough infections than others, the researchers found, especially following their first vaccine dose: people 60 and older who were considered frail, and people living in ""highly deprived areas"" such as densely populated communities. People who were not obese had lower odds of infection following their first vaccine dose, the data showed.

But overall, the researchers found that being vaccinated was associated with fewer reports of symptoms across all age groups if someone contracted the coronavirus.

Vaccination, compared with no vaccination, was associated with reduced odds of Covid-19 hospitalization or having more than five symptoms in the first week of illness following a first or second dose, the researchers found, and there were reduced odds of long-term symptoms lasting 28 days or more following a second vaccine dose.

Please remember that a Vaccine is when you are injected with a solution containing the deactivated virus to stimulate an immune response.

These Covid19 Jabs contain mRNA among with other dangerous and unethical components. The mRNA will enter your cells and start to produce the virus spike proteins. This has never been done at mass for humans before and these types of vaccines have never made it past animal trials due to the side effects.

Your body is going to be programmed to continue to produce these proteins and there is absolutely no guarantee or knowledge as to what is going to happen to you long-term.

"Had COVID March 2020: 45 hours after 1st shot, feeling worse than 24 hours
Hi all,

So I had COVID pretty significantly in March 2020.  I was not hospitalized, but had pretty acute symptoms and experienced some lingering long haul symptoms for about 3-4  months post infection.  

I received my first Moderna shot at 4:00pm on Saturday, Feb 27th.  The night of I was mostly tired about 6-8 hours after and just got a long night's sleep on Saturday.  Sunday I was feeling a bit better, mostly fatigue and a lingering headache.  Took it easy most of the day and got a good night's sleep again thinking I was through most of it, as I was feeling about 95% back to normal Sunday night.

Today I got up for work feeling mostly ok, but at about noon today (so about 44 hours post vaccine), I am suddenly feeling awful again.  Extremely tired, achey, and I have a fever of 99.5 with Tylenol in my system as I took 2 earlier this morning.  I assume it is a bit higher than that given I am on Tylenol and will retake after it's out of my system in a few hours.    


The nurse who gave me the vaccine did say I would likely have harsher side effects since I did have COVID previously, and in reading some experiences here it seems people who have had COVID seem to react harsher to the 1st dose in particular.   However it seems a lot of people seem to clear up around the 24-36 hour mark with most of the significant symptoms, but I seem to be getting worse with time.  I'm a little bummed as I was feeling pretty good through the last 40 hours thinking I was mostly done with this.

Has anyone else experienced a timeline like this?  I'm hoping this is just the tail end of it and my body is just doing its job making its antibodies again.  My hope is that I don't continue to feel any worse and hopefully will improve through the day and into tomorrow.  I do have some autoimmune issues, so I expected this to be a bit harsh combined with the fact that I already had COVID - but am a bit disheartened that my timeline so far is getting worse with time and not improving.

"Got my first COVID shot! ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â˜Ã‚ÂÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â’Ã‚Â‰
I got my first COVID shot a day ago and thought I'd share my experience in hopes it might help someone else--especially how dreary many of the posts here are and the general confusion regarding the vaccine for those with autoimmune disorders / on immunosuppressants.

I have autoimmune hepatitis and I'm currently on prednisone (7.5 mg) and azathioprine (75 mg). I got diagnosed early this year (which sucks cause I'm a senior in HS :( ) and I've been tapering my predisone for a few months so far. Although autoimmunity isn't great (and you guys can relate), I feel really lucky to have caught it before it got too serious.

I was worried about how my meds might make me more susceptible to COVID, so I discussed with my specialist and was told that the benefits outweigh any drawbacks in my situation. That seems to be the concensus with most autoimmune disorders where I'm from, but definitely discuss with your doc for a case-by-case verdict.

I got the Pfizer vaccine, and so far I'm feeling pretty great :) the only symptoms I felt were a VERY sore arm (interestingly more sore than previous vaccines I've gotten) and heavy exhaustion yesterday - but honestly, I'm just glad to see that my immune system is reacting! Not sure how effective the vaccine will end up being (since there isn't much research done for our group), but considering my medication dosages are pretty low, I don't think the impacts will be too? significant.

I hope this helped and that you have a great day! Feel free to ask anything!",1

We join hundreds of health systems and a growing number of employers in all fields across the country, including many in Pennsylvania, mandating employee vaccinations to protect against COVID-19. In addition, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Group Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and many more, have strongly recommended COVID-19 vaccine requirements for all healthcare workers. We stand with all of these respected organizations in putting the safety of our patients and staff first.

This will be in the regular news sources within the next few hours, but I thought I'd break the news first. 

For the record, I chose to get the vaccine as soon as it became available to us. And I approve of this decision.",1
"Is there an alternative to the internet to stay connected?
Guys, the unvaccinated are getting pushed, the people in society are getting divided.

The strategy employed by the elite is divide and conquer, our best defense against their strategy is to stay connected and informed.

The protests happening around many cities around the world is not brought up on mainstream media and deleted on social media, that means the average joe unless they're living in these places have no idea what's going on.

This is the power of controlling the flow of information, our only way of staying connected and aware of these things is by way of the internet which is currently being threatened.

On july 9th 2021, there was a meeting between members of the WEF, about potential cyberattacks that could cause a worldwide powergrid shutdown.

Last time a meeting of this sort was held was in october 2019 and the topic was about a potential pandemic.

If this happens it will be far more serious than the pandemic and will create a division from which we can't recover from unless we find a way to stay connected incase shit hits the fan.

That's all I wanted to say, take care of yourselves and remain logical, never think you can't learn something new.",-1

I got my first covid vaccine shot two days ago. First night had pretty hard time sleeping. I usually am a heavy sleeper but I just couldn't sleep.

I wanted to know if anyone else had the same issue? I think I read one comment somewhere in this sub about how someoneÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s was triggered after they got Covid. 

Do you think itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s worth it for me to even see a doctor? Or should I just take antihistamines and learn to live with it? Is there hopes of it going away?

Last week my 12 year old daughter was due to have her COVID jab in school. Anti vaxxers found out that they were vaccinating at the school and protested outside trying to prevent the vaccination team from getting into the school.

My daughter was one of those that missed out. Now a week later she has tested positive and is terrified. I have had to explain to her today why ""just getting the jab today"" wouldnt work.  I know her age means that she will probably have no issues at all, but I am so incredibly angry.",1

"Am i going crazy?
So let me get this straight..... 
According to the folks pressing me and others to get a jab, if you have the vax, you will be still able to get and pass on the ‘Rona, but “the symptoms will be less severe “ ?

I don’t watch much news, and i live in a pretty remote place and haven’t cared much, but this is the basic info as I understand. Please correct me if I’m wrong.

Now, if that is correct, and the reason for getting the jab is so we can get back to normal, and the people who have gotten the shot are already being told they can travel freely and do what they want, then aren’t they “super spreaders”? 

Their head honcho said masks don’t really work anyway. 
Not that i care, I’d rather everyone wear a mask than see alot of ugly expressions from folks anyway, people are too fucked to be happy and pleasant anyway. 
They travel and spread and blame the unvaxxed... they have a false sense of security and a false sense of Righteousness and are on the warpath. 

Or I’m seeing this all wrong? Really just wondering. I don’t want the shot, i don’t take any pharmaceutical drugs at all in my life. Vitamins, cannabis, good fresh food and a healthier than average lifestyle has done me great.",-1
"I got the first dose of the Covid vaccine and am so glad to be alive
Today I was finally able to take the first dose of my Covid vaccine. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m sorry if my writing is confusing, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m really not well right now. I took AstraZeneca, after several months waiting, and was immediately happy. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m overweight, and the new variants here in Brazil thanks to Bolsonaro are killing younger and younger people. A lot of people I know have been dying, and even some celebrities I liked. 

I knew I could get side effects, but the vaccine really destroyed me. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m having intense fever, headaches, feeling tiredness, and chills all over my body. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been having several deliriums too, this usually happens when i have fever, and spent a few hours during this last night talking to non-existing people. It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t scary, I knew they were merely my messed-up imagination, but it really made me think. 

If the vaccine made me feel like this, and it is a severely weakened version of some of the virus proteins or something, what if I caught the real thing? I know IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m safer now that I took the vaccine, but if I hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t and I caught the virusÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦ IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d be dead. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m not particularly healthy in my habits, but I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t usually get sick. If I caught covid IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d be six-feet under in a matter of days.

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m just so glad that everyone in my family that had this plague survived, and that IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m still alive. Even if the vaccine only made me 1% safer, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d still be worth it. This headaches and feverish chills and hallucinations are better than drowning in the hospital with your lungs being consumed by coronavirus. In august IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll be getting te second shot, and a third or fourth or fifth if necessary. 

And no, you donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get mind-hacked by Bill Gates or turn into an alligator. And even if you did, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d still be better than suffocating to death in a hospital bed.",1

I got my first shot Thursday at 2:30p. Felt great up until 8pm. Just fatigue and went to bed early but it was difficult to sleep. My arm definitely was sore. I woke up for work the following day around 6:30am and definitely felt more fatigue and my arm was extremely sore. I could barely lift it.  I still thought I could manage being in the office. Throughout the day, the fatigue was pretty bad and I had a little foggy brain and my eyes were heavy. I had lunch and no GI issues. I ended up taking Tylenol 500mg and it helped alleviate the fatigue for a couple hours. However, I was extremely cold the entire day. 
On my commute home, I could feel the fatigue returning and began having chills (this was now 28 hours after). I got home and the chills got worse and even being inside 3 blankets would not make me feel better about being cold. I managed to eat. 
ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s now been 32 hours later and I have a low grade fever, chills, began cramping (like period cramps) and diarrhea. So I just took pepto for the diarrhea and waiting for my bf to arrive with more Tylenol.

I thought the diarrhea was a non related issue but it seems from this forum that diarrhea could be a side effect. I could be wrong. But I just didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to feel alone in my diarrhea side effects lol

I recognise that people have had all kinds of different experiences with the covid vaccine. I just wanted to throw my experience in the mix to contribute to the bigger picture.

On Sunday 20th Feb I had the Astrazeneca jab at about 3pm. For the rest of the day I felt just completely normal. 

The next day I woke up feeling as if I had a very slight or subtle hangover. You know as if I'd had some beers but not an excessive number of beers !  But by about 11am I felt 100% and that it had just faded away as such a hangover would. I then went for a run that evening with no problems.

"Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine + POTS
Hi, I received my first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine yesterday. I thought that it may be helpful to share what my side effects were. 

Within about 30 minutes of receiving it, my arm was starting to feel a little bit weaker and tingly and I started developing a headache.
Within the next few hours the headache and arm soreness progressed, with the arm only getting to just a little sore and weak feeling. Not as bad as a tough workout. I was up and moving around at my job and I started getting pretty POTS-y. My heart rate was at &gt;=120 BPM and my balance and eyesight were both shaky. I made it back to my desk and drank a good amount of water including a nuun tablet over the course of the next hour and my body stabilized enough to feel okay. The rest of the day, I just made sure to be extra careful with my water intake and activity.

Overnight, I slept poorly and my arm advanced to feeling like I had done a tough workout and also had a big bruise on the injection site. My headache has persisted, but is manageable with Tylenol.



I hope that this information is helpful to anybody. Personally, I'd advise making sure that you have some good hydration options available for after the shot, and be prepared to take it easy day of.

I've included my bio/health stats below just in case anybody is curious or wants to see how similar their symptoms may be.

*2nd Dose Update *

Okay, first 10-12 hours after getting the shot, I felt fine. My arm was only barely sore during this time. After that, it got rough.
I tossed and turned all night with crazy fever dreams and was in a lot of pain all over. I also had a massive pounding headache. 

In the morning I took my temperature and had a fever of 100.5 F. I usually run around 97.5 F, and very very rarely get fevers over 99.5, so this was distinct for me. I called into work for the day and have mostly been sleeping and occasionally taking Tylenol. My heart rate has been consistently over 120 bpm. 

It's now been about 26 hours since receiving my 2nd dose and I'm feeling a bit better from this morning, but I still feel quite awful and feel unsteady when I stand up.

"Experience with Astrazeneca covid vaccine
Hey everyone, 
my boyfriend (who has primary Addisons) got his Covid vaccination yesterday and I just wanted to share how it went so you can be prepared for your shot if you get one. 

He has Addisons because of an autoimmune disease so this probably plays a role in how much his body reacted but maybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s still interesting for everyone. 

In the morning of his shot he double dosed on hydrocortisone as he was advised and he took the vaccination quite well. His arm hurt a bit but aside from that he was fine. But at night he got pretty high fever, chills and basically his whole body hurt. Obviously he got pretty sick because of so much stress and hence he had to take 40mg hydrocortisone at once. (This is the recommended amount for high fever following his doctor) We decided against using the emergency syringe he got from his doctor because he was still responsive and his blood pressure was ok, but that syringe was laying next to us and I was definitely ready to use it the second he would not have answered to me anymore. 
After he took the hydrocortisone and some ibuprofen to help with the pain and the fever he finally felt better. He was able to sleep and feels way better today. 

I think our advise would be to definitely make sure to double dose the day of the vaccination and have a lot cortisone available for the night. Make sure you know what is recommended for you in case of vaccination reactions including high fever and if possible please donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t stay alone for the day and night after the shot. 
Please donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t take this lightly and be prepared, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜t know when I was ever so sure he would fall into Addison crisis as last night. 

I really donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to scare or discourage anyone from getting vaccinated. I just wanted to give a heads up to not take this to lightly. My boyfriend says he thinks it was a good decision to get the shot anyway. If his body shows this reaction only to the vaccine who knows how it would go if he actually got the virus.

Hope everyone stays safe and this was kind of helpful for anyone!",1
"CMV: Any person who willingly declines to get vaccinated for COVID should be denied medical treatment if they are ultimately infected.
Preface: this does not apply to those who cannot be vaccinated due to pre-existing conditions or other health reasons.

The pandemic is continuing only because of people who are refusing to trust vaccines en masse. These people make up nearly all hospitalizations and COVID-related illnesses. Furthermore, I'd posit that the more likely you are to decline the vaccine, the likelier you are to engage in riskier behaviors such as avoid mask-wearing.

The end result is that our healthcare system is being overrun again and it was COMPLETELY avoidable. As a result, those who may need medical care may be denied because there simply aren't enough resources.

Imagine that we are all in a flood and the waters are rising. We are all stranded on our roofs and emergency services are thinned out. Some idiots decide ""the flood isn't real"" and voluntarily jump into the water and start to drown, pleading for help. Rescuers respond, but other people die too.  Why rescue those so willing to put everyone else at risk?

These people are either selfish, or idiots. They don't deserve medical care.",1

"Covid Caution
All, I caught Covid, and it caused me to miss a week's worth of work. I am vaccinated, an otherwise healthy person, and I really don't get sick. I was working a festival in a place that had decent Covid protocols... At least for the fans. I got home, took an at-home test 5 days later, and tested negative. Only when I went to get a test to go work my next gig 4 days after my first negative test did I find out I was positive. I was symptomatic at that time, but due to some home repairs, and aggressive exposure to my chief allergen, mold, I thought that was likely the culprit. The actual illness for me wasn't bad. As I said, I really did think it was just seasonal allergies, especially given my negative test. As the mucus load seemed to move more into my chest however I developed a cough and that persisted for about 48 hours. I've been at home for 7 full days and tested negative about half an hour ago.  

  

So now to what I think I did wrong:  

I was doing monitors for a festival, throw and go, 5-6 bands a day for 3 days. Obviously, the performers were not masked, and this particular festival didn't have any testing requirements for staff or performers. So I was situated for 3 days, exposed to 20+ people a day that may or may not have been positive, all doing an activity that allows for quite a bit of aerosols to be emitted. I was masked, save for when I was drinking water or eating. I think that if I had been more diligent about sanitizing my hands after changeovers, and had I been wearing an N95, or even double masking with an N95 and a 3 ply the chance that I would have caught it would have been greatly reduced.  

I'm proof the vaccine works. I caught a virus that has killed millions of people, and my treatment was Hall's cough drops and rest. I would encourage any of you that are going to be in positions where you're around untested, and/or unmasked populations to double down on your own masking and personal sanitation efforts. It could just keep you from canceling your next gig.",1
"These covid shots are to get big Pharma out of debt. HereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s proof.
Dr. Shiva, a biological engeneer, exposes pharmaceutical companies plan to get out of debt via vaccinations 

Pharmaceutical companies have not been doing well. They were losing 40 billion dollars over a long period of time, around 30 years. They were tanking. Vaccines are growing at 17%. Follow the money. Pfizer needs to come back up, and what better way to go up than to go into an industry where you cannot be sued (thanks to Ted Kennedy). They have issues with lawsuits and if this is a flop, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re out. Thanks to trump, which I supported, led us to operation warp speed, and what we have today is Pharma moving to a place where they canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be held accountable. They need to get to 70% vaccination rate, because when you work out the numbers, even if they just hit 35%, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll make 40 billion this year. Each dose is worth 20 dollars, and getting two doses is 40 retail. (I know WE get it free. They still get money) ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s very simple math. 
If you multiply 2.7 billion by 20, you get 48 billion. Israel has a deal with Pfizer. Other countries benefiting from Pfizer also mandate these vaccines.

But really not too awful. I rested a bit and really hydrated. Mixed some Gatorade with water 50/50 and drank a whole bottles worth both today and yesterday. 

I know others have had it worse, but I did want to share, as I think it helps to read about the experiences others have.

Edit:
Woke up on day 3 (about 36 hours after the shot) feeling normal as ever. Totally unexpected.",0

"I have genuine questions that I’m not sure I’ve seen anyone who is against the vaccine talk about
Why do you believe that the government is trying to kill its people? Financially does it make sense to kill off your workers and consumers? And all of the big corporations that are going to soon mandate vaccines from their employees.. why would they also put their workers in danger? We all know that the government is corrupt and that they’re just bought off the big companies. They are begging millennials to have children because we need workers. And also.. if they were trying to kill people wouldn’t it make more sense to kill off those who don’t just blindly follow the government? Wouldn’t they want to keep around those who are “sheep” because they’re more easily controlled? 

I can’t imagine that these giant multi-billion dollar companies would risk losing a huge chunk of workers/consumers. 

It could be to make us sicker, they already put stuff in our food that isn’t good for us and of course it benefits the insurance companies. But it seems like once the vaccine gets full FDA approval it’ll be very likely that insurance companies will push for vaccinations to lower their costs, and those who don’t get vaccinated might get higher premiums. But also, countries with free healthcare are getting the vaccine.. like Canada who is also using Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J. So the vaccine making us sicker will also cost companies more, which again I can’t see why they would do that since money is everything. 

They can already track us with our phones and listen in on us if they wanted to. So what’s the endgame here ?


Edit: I’m not sure why the post is getting downvoted. It’s something I’ve been thinking about recently and haven’t seen people really talk about when they talk about not getting the vaccine. I’m being perfectly respectful and even though I don’t agree with you guys, I came here to get answers from the very people that have these beliefs.",0

"Why you should care about NOT having a vaccine passport
I'm a computer engineer and have always closely followed privacy issues, and **the vaccination passport is a very scary prospect for our privacy and freedom**, maybe in more ways than you would think on the surface. I have been seeing some misconceptions in comments about ways to cheat the system, but they are way ahead of you on those.

Unfortunately it is something that was probably going to happen someday regardless of a virus or not, particularly after the Chinese implemented social credit. The vaccine is used just as an excuse at this point. Personally I wouldn't even mind the vaccine after waiting some time for long-term data, but the tracking that comes with a passport is unacceptable, and that is what we should be fighting.

Something I think should be clear is that there are two different, separate issues here, and they are both valid. The first is not wanting to take the vaccine. This is a valid standpoint, but basically solely an ethics question and a separate debate. The second is **not wanting to present identification when entering all/a lot/some businesses**, and this is the one I will talk about. The media/politicians will try to lump both together, but they are very distinct issues.

Technically the only thing you need to know is that you will have a barcode/QR code/ID number (doesn't even matter if it's on your phone or on a paper), and the place that you are entering has a digital scanner (a human checking papers is too easy to fool/too slow), so they are way ahead on that. To be able to admit you, your code has to be checked against a server-stored token, to prove your passport is legitimate.

Whenever a request is performed against the server, it follows a log will be produced of that identification request. Something like ""Mr John Smith, at Walmart SW LA, 03/03/2021, 3:15pm, does he have a vaccine/negative test/etc.?"", to which the server replies ""yes/no"".

Now all kinds of web servers produce some sort of log, maliciously or not, but you will never be able to tell whether the system you are using does it or not. And given that a chain of web servers interact with each other on modern architectures, and logging is a default on modern (or old for that matter) programs, it's a given someone will do it.

My objective with this post is to clear some confusion around what you could do to cheat the system, or to counter some arguments software agencies and health officials have been propagating. I'm not targeting any system in particular, but I'm attacking the system architecture that is being proposed, using the arguments I would use if someone pitched me a new system and I played the devil's advocate.

Discussing misconceptions/workarounds I have seen:

- ""**I'll use a paper one**"": Irrelevant. As long as the code is read by a machine, that machine will have to consult a server, to where your ID is sent. This is not a ""disable your location services"" kind of system, the tracking is done by the scanning party. No scanner? Maybe the clerk just types a number on his phone, same thing from a privacy standpoint, your ID is sent somewhere out of your control. Given that the trend is to replace human agents with machines (ticket control, store assistants, etc) I hardly believe we will see a new human-based job appearing. It will be like scanning your ticket at the train station.

- ""**I'll get a fake passport**"": Could work only if the store/gate agent/whatever didn't have a digital scanner, and only looked at papers (knowing that this is cumbersome, and they know there will be cheaters, this will not be the case). If the verification is done on the server side nothing short of hacking that server would help you, and even then your ""life log"" could have already been backed up somewhere. ""Things on the internet last forever"" is true, in the sense that even if you delete something, you have no way of knowing if someone has saved a copy.

- ""**I'll share my passport with my friends to confuse them**"": The owner's photo might be stored on their server, and that will appear on their scanner, thus showing you are not the owner to a nearby agent/AI face recognition system (not sci-fi, and at this point in time, the system could evolve into being just a camera on their end that could check you are indeed vaccinated and hence track you, no need to even have a paper).

- ""**I'll get my doctor friend to forge an exemption**"": Sure, you can escape the vaccine, but you still have to present your ""exempt"" passport, hence you are tracked just as anyone else. Same logic for negative tests, or for someone who was already infected. You are still an ID being associated with places. Should the purpose of the system be to track you, then it doesn't matter whether you have a vaccine or not, just that you comply with mandatory identification.

- ""**The scanner does not contact any server, my QR code has a verifiable signed token that the scanner reads locally**"": Theoretically fine, but how can you be sure the scanner does what the government/ID provider tells you it does? Maybe it just stores your credentials locally for in-store tracking (the same way a store card would), but do you want that to be legally mandated? Maybe it shares them with some related companies for marketing. The point is if you do not know what the other party is doing, you do not participate. The best way for your nudes not to leak on the internet is not sharing them in the first place.

- ""**The passport does not have my name associated**"": You know bitcoin? It's paraded as the private currency. It's not controlled by any government. Yet, the police has been able to arrest people by using inference attacks. These sort of attacks are very powerful, it is detective work but on a digital scale. Maybe to the passport you are just ""John Doe"", but you are the John Doe that checks-in every day to workplace X, that goes every week to Starbucks Y at a small town, that goes every month to state Z. It's not hard for law enforcement to then go around and find out who you are if they know your routine. You have nothing to hide? Until you are in the wrong place at the wrong time again.

- ""**The government would not do such a thing, they care only about health**"": Let's suppose it is so. There is still a system that is capable of logging your whereabouts. And no system in the world is perfectly safe. Let's say it gets hacked. Now your life data is somewhere on the dark web being sold to the highest bidder. Maybe some house thiefs noticed that today you checked-in at a shop 1000 miles away from your workplace. The data is anonymized? Lets go back to the inference attacks. If the police is able to do it, so are hackers. And a database of life itself surely is a prime target for attacks.

- ""**I really trust my friend's hacking skills**"": No system is perfect, so hacking it will be possible. But it's only a matter of time until your exploit gets fixed, so it will always be a game of cat and mouse. It's much easier for data to be stolen from the server as in the point above, since that attack only needs temporary access to the server.

- **""We are already tracked everywhere""**: Sure. Visa tracks you. Mastercard as well. Facebook. Google. Your phone provider. But each has their own system. The police can request data from each one of them, which is a bureaucratic process. Banking in particular has old systems. And it's not all put together neatly in a system built from the ground up, where a simple query can show everything a given person has done throughout his life. And all of the former are opt-in too.

- **""Vaccination passports already exist""**: Come on, you are really telling me you have always shown a vaccination passport to buy groceries, to go to the cinema or for interstate travel? Might have been so to go to 4 or 5 African countries, nothing more.

- **""I have nothing to hide""**: Until whatever you did that was legal and allowed is not anymore. Royalty and even landowners in general had nothing to hide in Russia until 1917. Plus you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time and be accused of something you did not do. Maybe you checked in to to a restaurant and a supermarket the same day as a suspect, and the police wrongly put 2 and 2 together. And if they tell you it is private, it's a matter of time until someone decides it is not.

It's still soon to know implementations of the passport, and how often or where it will be used (international travel vs buying groceries). But knowing how a system is designed, and regardless of the ""privacy level"" they are parading, there will always be a lot of flaws on the concept itself. And forcing people to abdicate their privacy in every aspect of daily life, for whatever reason, is just appalling and downright unethical.

We need to shift the focus away from this being about the vaccine, and focusing on it being about tracking. Could have happened just as well after 9/11 if the tech was there. I know most people will cave in when they are told that they will not get a job without the passport, or won't be able to buy food. Unless we are aware of the ramifications of such a system, and go outside to protest or boycott it. Because once it's accepted it is not going anywhere. And remember, a vaccination tracking system is, first of all, a tracking system.

**TLDR:** Don't try to beat the covid tracking system, you need to prevent it from ever existing in the first place

slowly but surely the real picture is showing about these vaccines

im glad I have never been an early adapter/beta tester for anything new and always wait things through before deciding. this tactic has payed off.

we have public outdoor ""gyms"" (loosest form of the word) where people were coming to do some excercises and I asked many there if they took the vaccine. those who have taken the vaccine know NOTHING about it. they know nothing about what they got themselves into. those who havent have done tons of research on it and hence they came to the conclusion to not take it or stand on the side and wait. their intuition has proven beneficial to at least dig deeper. very ironic that those who just leapt at taking the shot know nothing about it and how it works and why its even controversial. those who are against it, are far more educated about it.

brainwashing by the medical field, govt and news/media

throwing up percentages/graphs and those fake tv stunts with fake saline injections of celebrities and politicians insult peoples intelligence. when it comes to the most critical question ""what about long term side effects?"" they deflect. 

the truth is coming out about these. we have stagnated at 50% or less of the population. they went from 60yo+ to 16yo+ in a very short time. giving it to foreign workers and even palestinians. ""success"" as some have called it is a lie.",-1

"International student in OSU asking for some insight and explore options.
**Disclaimer:** OSU made itself clear months ago that it would consider making vaccines mandatory, so I did get vaccinated.

Oregon State University is making vaccinations mandatory for in-person learning. This policy will take place as soon as the Fall term begins in September, 2021. My opening comment states that I did in fact get vaccinated because, given the circumstances of lockdown in Oregon, it at the very least gave me the option of taking the mask off. In no way would I lie about my health status to take advantage of a situation.

With that being said, I have come to a crossroads with Fall term coming up. Although I did get vaccinated, I do not want to participate in a ""vaccine passport"" effort that would incentivize the Orwellian agenda pursued by the overlords at the top of our hierarchies. As a result, these are some options that I have, according to OSU:

1) Register my vaccine record and become another sheep in the herd.

2) Claim a medical or non-medical exemption.

Claiming for a medical exemption is a no-go because it does not apply to me and, once again, I will not lie. Non-medical exemptions are a little trickier, but the waiver states the following:

[Student Attestations waiver sent by OSU](https://preview.redd.it/46sot9awklg71.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e06c4af0addf31edef01bc2f2c1cc6e23a32f2)

As noted above, the last point clearly says:

&gt;I verify that I am declining receiving a COVID-19 vaccination

"/u/kairusan86 on What are your thoughts on the COVID vaccines?
The vaccine protects the person who receives the vaccine. So if I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to take the vaccine, it shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t matter to you as long as you take it.

I don't think it's possible that you've actually never heard the epidemiological position on this. Vaccines protect both you and EVERYONE ELSE AROUND YOU, because it (often) prevents you from being an asymptomatic spreader of a disease. So yes, by not getting the vaccine you are absolutely putting others at risk even if you're not at risk due to your own individual health characteristics. While I don't think people should be held down and forced to receive a vaccination, I think it's 100% fair for society to restrict their ability to put others in danger.

"Getting the COVID vaccine with a slightly elevated d-dimer? (Covid recovered patient)
Hi all, 

I was covid positive in Feb 2021. Recovered and am basically back to 100% or close to. Walking around and going about my day like normal. In mid March, I went to check if everything if back to normal  (blood work and general check up (lung x-ray, EKG, etc)). Everything came back normal except for a slightly elevated d-dimer (0.5). My doctor said because covid is a disease of the vasculature, it actually not out of the ordinary. She ruled out DVT and PE based on a clinical probability assessment. I wasn't too worried at that time, I know that a slightly elevated d-dimer can present itself after a disease like covid. I only inquired about my d-dimer because I was looking to start birth control and wanted to make sure I wasn't inviting any unnecessary risks to an already (but slightly) elevated d-dimer. She told me to just wait till my d-dimer stabilizes and get my d-dimer retested end of April or early May. Ok great no problem.

Fast-forward to this week. I'm all signed up to get my vaccine. I have been hearing reports about a slight risk of blood clots, and while I understand that it's a very rare/small occurrence, I wanted to make sure that my d-dimer was back to normal before I got the vaccine. So I had my blood work yesterday, and sure enough my d-dimer did decrease (0.48). **But since it is still close to the higher end of the d-dimer threshold (0.48 v. 0.5), I'm wondering if I should be waiting until it dips lower before I get the shot?**  I don't know what the correlation is of people who already had an elevated d-dimer getting blood clots from the shot, and just want to make sure I'm not one of them. To be clear, I'm not trying to be a vaccine denier, I 100% support getting vaccinated.

"COVID Vaccine success story - Day 4 - no urges so far

"The Catch-22 of Covid 19 vaccines: It is called a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated"" yet the vax (95% effective) doesnt stop the spread but does reduce symptoms. So shouldnt the unvaxxed fear the vaxxed?!
Does anyone else find it bizarre that the people that are vaccinated blame the unvaccinated for the variants even though it's now known that even the vaccinated can contract covid and can spread it and some are even dying of it. So why is it that the vaxxed are so hostile toward the unvaxxed?! 

I mean seriously, apparently everyone is still capable of spreading this virus around regardless of vaccination status. Get vaccinated and you will have less symptoms but you can still get covid and spread it around. The unvaccinated people are probably more at risk from being around the vaccinated people than the other way around LOL!

And how is it a pandemic of the unvaccinated if we now know that the vaccine protects against severe covid but does not keep people out of the hospital and does not prevent transmission of the virus? Wouldn't it be more likely that vaccinated people would spread covid add an even greater rate than the unvaccinated because they are asymptomatic? And someone who is on vaccinated would get sick and stay home and isolate in theory?

These are just the questions I'm grappling with and trying to make sense of this whole ridiculous situation! 

Me personally? I did get vaccinated because I Don t really think the vax is for something sinister ie. Mark of the beast, or depopulation.

"My experience at York College getting the COVID shot
I was very pleasantly surprised at how smooth the process was! 

I had my appointment today at 8:15am. I arrived on campus at 8:05am. There was no lines outside of the building. 

The registration process took about 3-4 minutes. At 8:11am I was waiting on the queue to enter the gymnasium where all the vaccination booths are. Whilst waiting on the queue, they asked us to watch a short infomercial about the vaccine and the possible side effects of the vaccine. 

At 8:15am I was already seated in one of the booths. One of the navy personnel asked me for the registration confirmation and my ID. No one asked for proof of eligibility. He asked whether I have any questions about the vaccine, he scheduled by 2nd dose appointment and at around 8:20 I got the vaccine administered.  There was quite a lot of people in the observation area, but it makes sense, considering that there were about 30 vaccination booths around the whole building. The military personal was also extremely kind and friendly. 

I was told to wait outside in the observation area for 15 minutes. All together, the whole experience took around 35 minutes. 

I'm almost 2 hours post vaccination. No weird side effects. It does feel itchy, I did experience about 20 minutes of intense heat radiating in the injection area and some tingling.",1

Not Wearing a mask, the anti vaccine movement, along with ivermectin being pushed are part of an organized effort to kill and sterilize those who fall for it. I have been wondering why the establishment is pushing a narrative that puts people at risk for a disease that potentially kills and even sterilize people. I've also wondered why an antiparasitic drug that is ineffective has been pushed as part of this same narrative. then I came across the study of ivermectin  essentially sterilizes  85% percent of men who take it. 
masks have been historically long been used in pandemics, the concept of a vaccine has long existed and is based on sound science, and saying ivermectin works on Covid is like saying a gun works on Covid. yeah it'll kill the Covid, but at the doses required it will kill you.

"HSG, Vaginismus, and the second COVID dose: a Letter from an NGP
Hello to this darling community. 

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m writing this from a new account to avoid sharing personally identifying information- IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m a long time follower of this sub on my main account. 

Today, my wife and partner and best friend and inspiration of 10 years underwent an HSG for the first time. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve read a lot about this procedure and my wife was nervous but felt this would bring her some peace of mind about what had to happen next as we continue TTC. 

Some background, my wife got her second COVID vaccine dose yesterday morning, and at 2am she woke up with chills, nausea, muscle aches and stiffness, just all the things that can make you feel like a human garbage bin. This girl rallied, hopped on the car at 6:30 am, and went in for this procedure like it was nothing. The girl is tough as nails. On top of feeling so terrible, my wife suffers from vaginismus which makes every single ultrasound and use of speculum just so extra painful. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s had to go through our 4 IUIs (and of course countless ultrasounds) so far by herself because of COVID precautions- but today I got to be with her in the room as she underwent the cramp-inducing horror of an HSG just a few hours later. 

I canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t describe how incredible it was to see my wife handle herself today. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t put into words how it felt to see her breathe deep and squeeze my hand while having a literal metal clamp placed on her cervix, a catheter inserted, and dye flushed into her uterus and ovaries. 

I feel overwhelmed with admiration. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll be a puddle when this gets to the point that we hopefully have a child of our own, but today IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m just completely overwhelmed by her strength and devotion. 

IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m posting this here because I hope each of you feel admired today- what a hellish, challenging, exciting, devastating thing this is that youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re doing. Best of luck to each of you as you navigate this process.",1

"I developed Bell’s palsy 18 minutes after my first dose of Pfizer. Doctor claims this was not vaccine related and to get my second dose.
I was not sure where to post this. Hope it’s okay. So I recently was hired at a new job. They require me to get vaccinated or show proof of exemption. Mind you I have been totally against the vaccine and have refused to get it but I have been without work for fourth months. So even though I felt sick and nervous and something bad was going to happen I chose to get my shot today. 

10 minutes after my shot in my left arm I started to feel dizzy. The lady seemed concerned and told me to wait another 15 but I said I’ll be fine and walked out. 9 minutes later the left side of my mouth started to droop to the left and my tongue fell to the left side of my mouth. I called the advice nurse and became confused, not being able to tell her basic information about myself. 

I stuttered, slurred my words, and felt literally intoxicated. She said get somewhere safe and wait three minutes she needs to talk her doctor. Answers the phone again panicked and says call 911 we think you are having a stroke. 

I call 911 and the ambulance shows up I tell them I just got my vaccine. They tell me I’m not having a stroke and says I am just having a panic attack. They told me the hospital won’t be able to do anything for me and to go back in my house , lay down, and watch a movie. 

I decided to drive myself to the ER. I told the doctor I was happy, healthy, and fine before getting my shot. He performed multiple tests and diagnosed me with Bell’s palsy. At that point I could no longer blink my left eye, and I’m biting the left side of my tongue because it’s falling to the side, and I can’t smile correctly. 

He claims this was not from the shot and says it is just a coincidence even tells me to go ahead and get the second dose in a few weeks. I now have to take six prednisone pills twice a day, and five viral pills twice a day which causes insomnia and weight gain and a shit ton of other things. I do not feel like myself, I am stuttering, confused, can’t find the words.

I am traumatized and I will do whatever I have to do to warn others of this. How ironic I get the shot on my left side and my Bell’s palsy is on the left side. I will never get the second dose.

   As an Unfortunate Survivor (36m) of COVID-19 who didn't die and instead gets to live with it as I wasn't essential enough for the vax in February of 21';  I get to deal forever with a left scarred pneumonia lung, an over inflamed heart that i can feel the left centrical valve pumping always, plus the enlarged liver/kidney damage felt on the left body side. All together which created the 24/7 body aches still occuring, that has all the bendable joint areas on my left side go into inflammation pain shock at times. Extra side affect: cold ice water gives me heartburn now. I then after got both the moderna shots to make sure I do not catch a variant of any source.

   What if the 99% survival rate is the bigger actual issue per the ones who survived maybe actually don't in the long run? As a minimum, some have to suffer like me till death finally comes and the other survivors definitely got some hours or years taken off their life even if they don't realize it yet...

  Even Asymptomatic doesn't mean a Shingles type issue like with Chicken Pox wont occur in years later for Covid survivors. Those that don't seem sick now might get sick years from now; what if the virus just stays dormant until it can do proper damage once your immunity lessons at ageing...

"The WORST take on the Covid MRNA vaccines you will ever hear
Last night I had a discussion with my gf's mother who knows I'm vehemently opposed to the Covid vaccination program in my country and the division it's causing. 

She told me she has a pharmacist friend who said the vaccine is actually good for you because there's protein in it.

Equating a foreign protein that literally triggers an immune response in your body to the proteins that we eat as part of a balanced diet... You know, the naturally occurring proteins that our body uses? From a pharmacist...who is undoubtedly seeing people get the injection in her own workplace. 

Undoubtedly this is the most braindead take I have heard in eighteen months and it's downright dangerous to equate a foreign protein occurring on the surface of a virus to naturally occurring proteins we consume. 

Essentially the injection which causes the production of millions of foreign proteins in your cells is like consuming a protein shake or a steak.

"I got my COVID vaccine this week
Based on my age and general health, I was expecting to have to wait quite a while before being eligible for the COVID vaccine. However, this week I became eligible in my state based solely on my BMI.

This was a wake-up call for me. While I know that BMI is an imperfect measure, I have been feeling for a while that I need to lose weight. But now this is more than just a nagging feeling, it's an indirect statement from my state.

This is particularly ironic considering I've spent the past year staying at home thinking I should lose weight but taking no action. Now that the true motivation is here, it's towards the (hopeful) end of the pandemic. Within the next year, I'll probably have to start traveling for work again, as well as have opportunities for meeting friends for drinks or unhealthy food. Now that I'm actually planning on doing losing weight, of course there will be more potential obstacles. I'm kicking myself for ""wasting"" the past year, however it's already done; I need to change my focus to the future.

I'm going to spend the time between now and my second shot making a plan for the upcoming year. And then on the one-year anniversary of my second shot, my goal is to have a BMI in the normal weight category.

2. The vaccines will kill and seriously harm some people.  But the percentage is small enough that the net benefit is still massively worth it.  (This is a hard pill to swallow)
3. Not everyone actually needs the vaccine.  But we don't have a clear idea of who that is.  Many people are unhealthy, have underlying conditions or are genetically predisposed to fair poorly with COVID.  We just don't know.  So blanket policy is all we have.  (another tough one to get down)
4. If the vaccines prevent even just 5% of people from going to the hospital do some quick math on how many people that is in a country like the USA or even Canada.
5. It's not about a shortage of ICU beds its about a shortage of nurses to tend to them.  You can't just double your trained nurses in 18 months.  Schooling/training takes time.
6. This pandemic is a real threat to all of us in one way or another.  If we could just start their we would be much better off.
7. The messaging from all politicians during this time has been abhorrent and divisive.  The vaccinated don't need to be protected from the unvaccinated.  They need to take a back seat and let Doctors, Nurses and Epidemiologists guide us.
8. Early treatment and vaccines are not exclusive of each other.  If a drug has a good safety record and promising anecdotal studies we should be trying it.

"I got my covid vaccine!
I have ocd and am super hypochondric, I feared both of those damn vaccines so much, I literally feared to die because of it and I often do really think that I have to die from a stroke or anything like that, but I put that all aside to get vaxxed against covid. 
When I got my first shot I was so anxious that I vomited right in front of the medical staff, when I received my second one I had to sit there for a long time because I had a full blown panic attack and no medication with me. 
But I still did it and even tho I thought that I had to die, guys, I made it out alive! And so can you.",1
"Stepmom is ignoring my question about COVID vaccine and visiting my baby.
I'm due in June. My stepmom has been the most loving and supportive person in my life even though she's no longer married to my dad. She has purchased a lot for me and baby during my pregnancy and has just been an excellent support. I live in a different state and she's wanting to visit us after a while, and I want her to as well! 

Problem is she's very anti-COVID, as in, doesn't believe it's a big deal, thinks masks are a government overreach/control thing, ignores all the stay at home stuff. I've asked her twice now if she's gotten the COVID vaccine, or plans to, and both times she's left my messages on read and not responded. I absolutely want her to meet my kid but the fact is we don't know enough about COVID to say it's safe for baby to meet her. Baby will be right around 2 months old if she does come. We've asked all our other family members to get vaccinated when they can, and they've all agreed because they understand baby will have no protection other than the antibodies I might be able to pass along(I am fully vaccinated and will be breastfeeding if I can). 

This is important to me, because obviously it's my job to keep him safe. I don't want to give an ultimatum if I don't have to but she's obviously avoiding this. How should I proceed?",1

"Mixing Covid vaccines from Sinovac and Pfizer - what could go wrong?
Title, but let me provide a little context.

I (25M) got a shot of Sinovac's CoronaVac in the Philippines 25 days ago as of writing. I'm due for a 2nd dose in 3 days, but the problem is I am currently in the US for the next 25 days and they only have Pfizer / Moderna vaccines here, no Sinovac CoronaVac anywhere. So I am going to miss / be late for my 2nd Sinovac dose.

Due to some personal circumstances, I am considering to get fully-vaxxed with Pfizer / Moderna within the 25-day period I am here in the US, instead of taking the late 2nd dose of Sinovac upon return to the Philippines.

However, I was told at a CVS near me that Sinovac and Pfizer / Moderna must not be taken together within 60 days of each other. As there isn't enough statistics on mixing vaccines, I figured that this 60-day thing is just a precautionary protocol without solid basis. I wonder what kind of risk I'm taking if I was to insist on taking 1st dose of Pfizer today then 2nd dose 21 days later, considering I've just been injected with Sinovac 25 days ago.

I would appreciate some expert opinion and insight.

TLDR: I have to be fully-vaxxed by November 20. I can make it if I take Pfizer today, except I took 1st of 2 doses of Sinovac 24 days ago and was told to wait 36 more days before taking Pfizer.",1
"Spotting after taking the COVID vaccine.
Hi everyone, 
IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve taken my second COVID vaccine 3 days ago and IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been spotting since the first one which was about 2 weeks ago. So IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been spotting for about a month now, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m pretty regular with my period It also last 7 days. 3 days heavy bleeding and then goes away, but after the vaccine I was suppose to get my period; which I guess I did. Just no pain and very light and dark blood and Ive continued spotting since. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been a month now! 
IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m getting a little nervous now, has anyone gone through something similar? Or what can it be ? 

Thanks in advance!",0
"If you are able to get the Covid Vaccine, please do it
I see way too much hesitancy behind getting the covid vaccine in this sub, and it's honestly disheartening. If you are able to get the vaccine and you choose not to, you are not only hurting yourself, but people around you.

Let's start off by saying there is 0 supported evidence that the vaccine causes a permanent spike in Tinnitus. When you receive the vaccine, your immune system is essentially going into a higher productive state to develop antibodies that protect you from covid replicating inside your body. Due to your body working harder, you could temporarily perceive your Tinnitus to be louder, just like when you get a cold or allergies. But that is completely temporary. 

I'm not going to say there aren't fringe cases that people develop long term ringing in their ears due to some poor reaction, as there are a small amount of people that are allergic to vaccines or other reasons. But that is a very rare population of people. There also may be other reasons such as increased anxiety or stress over it.

Just like any subreddit, these fringe cases are going to be highlighted, and unfortunately it scares a lot of people.

Also, it is important to note there ARE significant amounts of reports of people developing long term Tinnitus from GETTING COVID. https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201106/covid-may-cause-tinnitus

You almost have only 2 choices. Getting the vaccine that has a very high success rate and no evidence of Tinnitus specifically as a side effect, or battling covid which has shown to be dangerous. Getting the vaccine not only protects you, but people around you from getting sick. Please get the vaccine if you can

If you are worried you should speak to your doctor as I'm not giving true medical advice",1
"Disney Employee Here
So they finally decided to do it. All employees including myself have to be vaccinated by September 28th. Feels like Iâ€™m staring down the barrel of a gun.

You know, because they care about my safety.",-1
"Babes that have had COVID and have gotten both doses of Pfizer or Moderna -- which shot was worse?
I got COVID in the spring last year, and then was extremely exposed again this January by the guy I was seeing at the time but 3 PCR tests and later an antibody test revealed no signs of an infection...I assumed because I still had some immunity from spring. After both exposures I developed a constant dull headache for a few days after the actual infection

I got my first shot of Moderna on Wednesday. I initially felt just kinda funky, but at around 30 hours I started getting dizzy and the same COVID headache but soo much worse, and my whole body just feels really gross. I've been absolutely dreading the second dose but I found one single news article about how side effects may be worse after the first dose if you've already had COVID than with the second, but there's no other info on it. 

So i'm just curious what yall's experience has been? 

Listen, I'm a big girl and I can still force myself to saddle up for the second dose regardless; it's a small price to pay for protecting my community. But boy it sure would make the medicine go down easier if any of you had an easier time with the second.",1
"Can anyone provide me any data that would convince the love of my life that the Covid-19 vaccine isnt as straightforward in terms of safety or intent so that she will maybe not get the second injection?
So to preface, I've been in a steady relationship with the love of my life and soul-mate for going on 5 years now. She recently within the last 4 months got a job working at one of our more local health departments. Well one day someone who was scheduled to receive a vaccine didn't show and my girlfriend decided that she would take it since the person it was intended for never showed up. Now, shes only received the first of the two injections and it's only been within the last month that she got it. After seeing all the empirical data that calls into question the integrity of the vaccine itself as well as the intentions of it's ""backers"". And after switching my mindset on the subject, I've been attempting to convince her not to receive the second injection. I'm seriously concerned for her wellbeing and just cannot get her to understand my stance on why I do not want her to receive the second injection. All she keeps saying is she hasnt seen but 1 person die from it and a few random side-effects here and there and that she will be fine. Yet no matter what data or evidence I show her concerning how safe or deadly the vaccine is, all she says is she doesnt wanna look irresponsible at work, waste the first injection and that she will be fine. I cannot live without this chick, as sappy as it sounds, it's very much the truth. So with the prefacing out of the way, is there something anyone could suggest i show her to maybe get her mind going? Thanks to any and all help.",-1
"Vaccines donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t stop the spread of covid so there really is no point to these mandates
At this point, insane liberal redditors are just obsessed with the vaccine for no reason. Every thread, every day, there are hoards of gay redditors sucking big pharma dick demanding everyone get vaccinated. It seems that in the course of 8 or so months, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve somehow changed the definition of vaccine. It used to be a shot youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d get to stop you from catching or spreading an illness, but now out of thin air this is no longer the expectation

At this point, there are people upset that others are not doing something to make the virus worse for themselves. So it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t even effect anyone else. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s like the federal government mandating that you take Tylenol when you have a hangover, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s fucking ridiculous ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â˜Ã‚Â‚

If there is such a rabid concern over individuals health or vulnerability to illness, why arenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t redditors demanding that fat people are dropped them their health insurance? 

Go ahead, downvote me. While your at it, let me see some of your robotic, copy and pasted, tired buzzphrases in defense of the vaccine that read as though they were straight from PfizerÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s PR department. I love seeing that bullshit big pharma shilling on Reddit

"Those who've had Covid: how were your side effects after the 2nd jab?
I had Covid 6 months before I got my first jab after which I felt pretty terrible for about 36 hours (my arm hurt really bad for 3 days).

So I'm really just curious how the second dose of Moderna is going to effect me: will I feel even more terrible than after the first OR is my body now so used to dealing with the virus that I won't feel much?

"PSA: most people don’t care that much either way
Sometimes it’s easy to lose track of reality amidst the online discourse around contentious issues. I submit that most people don’t have strong feelings around the vaccine. It’s important to keep in mind that the vaccine evangelists and the anti vaxxers and the anti anti vaxxers and the anti anti anti vaxxers (the group I most identify with personally)are a tiny but highly vocal minority of people. The nature of online spaces makes this debate feel much larger and dominating than it actually is.

"Covid vaccine causes strange smells
28M, occasional alcohol use, no known medical issues. 

Strange smell after Pfizer vaccine.

I got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine a little over a week ago. About three weeks ago, I started having strange smell related symptoms and am curious if this is normal. 

Basically about half of everything I eat/drink has a very weird smell, but it all smells the same. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s almost like my sense of smell makes sugar smell very weird and unpleasant. So anything that has sugar in it smells the same, but it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t smell like sugar. IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m using sugar as an example because I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t know what the actual ingredient it, but I know itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not sugar. Some common foods/drinks that have this smell: black coffee, bread, sugar free Red Bull, lunch meats, cheese etc.. it seems like itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s mainly processed foods.

I hate the fact that I’m still a part of this medical experiment and that the school is overreaching by acting like my doctor &amp; as if they know what’s best for me and others.

Obviously I don’t like the fact that I’m still being forced to provide my dna in the form of spit but at least I’m not shoving invasive instruments in to my body.
