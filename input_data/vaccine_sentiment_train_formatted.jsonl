If we stop the corona vaccine, will Corona stop mutating?\n\nWhat Im about to say is deadly fucking serious, and the course of action is ONLY to be taken when certain countrywide conditions are met. Big Pharma may NEVER admit their vaccines are the reason viruses like Corona can mutate. If they continue their booster shot plan and keep a new shot going every year, they may literally kill 75% of the global population that once lived healthy in 2019. \n\nIF American (and any other country that reads this and wants to do the same) society LITERALLY falls apart because of the mass deaths hitting everyone, and IF the scientists and Big Pharma dont come to their senses and stop the vaccines on their own, then the Militia must reform and take aggressive action against the vaccine. Those who are still remaining, if the country has fallen apart, and its literal pandemonium in the streets because of out of control variants, you must DESTROY vaccine production and destroy EVERY supply of it like a fucking Revenuer looking for alcohol. That means armed invasions of hospitals, clinics, and store pharmacies, forcing them to hand over the vaccines for destruction. That means armed invasions of vaccine manufacturing plants. You dont need to kill anyone in these locations, a show of force will be enough, and if you overwhelm local law enforcement, if its even still functioning in that month, there will be little resistance. If it takes burning down vaccine manufacturing plants, so be it. \n\nIm not calling for this action any time soon. Because you know, terrorism charges and all that. Youll know the day you need to rise up and act. When that day comes, society will likely have already devolved into literal Civil War, with one side killing each other, blaming them for the variants. While the scared and angry are out killing each other, groups of smart people need to carry out these strikes against the vaccine and its spike protein super power giving ability if the government is still trying to distribute that shit, and all you have noticed is the variants are just running wild and deadlier year after year. I may not be around to start this contingency plan myself. Who knows if the virus gets me too, I havnt had it yet. Read this, remember it. Use your common sense.  \n\nThe government has shown they are NOT looking out for our health. We have the evidence the vaccine is making things worse right before our eyes. Theyre already admitting it, even in liberal rags, yet enforcing the vax left and right to work jobs and travel. If the governments wont save us, and stays on the Big pharma payroll making things progressively worse year after year with this particular virus, then this strike plan against the vaccine production must be taken.   \n\nFor now we can only cross our fingers, hope Big Pharma and Big Science comes to its fucking senses and fixes the shit they unleashed on the world, and hopefully our natural immunity saves most of us, and the mRNA spike protein powered super variants arent enough to kill 50% or more of us in a true pandemic. Ive always said I'll play nice and maintain my perfect spotless criminal record until shit gets really real. When each of us notice 50% or more of our family and friends going down to Corona, Shit is officially Real then. That is the day you act to Save Humanity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "negative"}]}

ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤ *of course this is only my experience and yours may differ but mine is fairly textbook.\n\nDose 1: Went to a walk in vaccination centre. I told the intake nurse I was terrified of both needles and side effects. She sat with me and let me know what the real side effects could be and gently dismissed the not real ones I had in my head. She took me to a private room with a bed to lay down on and offered me juice and cookies which was super sweet haha. She said I could sit there and relax for as long as needed before the shot but I told her if we didn't do it now I may run out lol. \n\nThe actual shot- I know you've heard this before but genuinely it barely hurt. Felt more like a pinch than a needle and it was done in under one second. After it was over I had a massive panic attack and felt faint so they gave me the juice box and got me cold paper towels for my head. Panic attack lasted 5 minutes but I laid there for 25 minutes to make sure I was alright and they never asked me to leave earlier. \n\nSide effects:\n\nDay 1- no side effects.\nDay 2- sore arm only.\nDay 3- nothing!\n\nDose 2: Same experience with the walk in centre. Everyone is super nice and doesn't care if you act like a baby, they have seen it all and just want you to be vaccinated and healthy! Shot managed to hurt even less, still had a panic attack but this time came prepared with my own ice pack and the panic lasted less time. Didn't need to stay longer than the 15 minutes.\n\nSide effects:\n\nDay 1- felt fatigued that evening, not super bad but just wanted to nap off and on.\nDay 2- the part I was worried about, flu like symptoms. I had a low grade fever and muscle aches. It definitely wasn't pleasant but it only lasted 6 hours and I was able to fall in and out of sleep. By 2pm my fever was gone and my body aches went down to a dull soreness. Still a bit sleepy and my arm hurt a 4/10. Took Tylenol and Advil and drank a LOT of Gatorade and was able to play Minecraft the rest of the day.\nDay 3- all better!\n\nThe process was definitely way less scary than the months of anxiety I had leading up to it! The chances of having a severe reaction is literally one in a million and even if it happened all the staff are trained for that!\n\nThis post isn't to convince anyone to get their vaccines, just an in depth breakdown of what it was like if you're like me and don't find vague information helpful enough.

Do not let that be taken away because the unwise pander half truths and ignore plain fact.\n\nPut aside the foolishness of the media and naysayers who are in the tiniest minority and get vaccinated.

You're actively endangering public health by giving COVID more host bodies in which it can grow and mutate. I think most of us here agree about that. So if you're willing to make such a selfish decision regarding this disease, you shouldn't be entitled to hospital care. Forget the hippocratic oath here - the hospitals here in America have only so many beds. Thoughtful people with emergencies are being turned away or having treatment delayed because hospitals are bursting at the seams with patients. It's frankly unacceptable that these people are being robbed of timely medical care because of the stupidity of others.\n\nI'm not saying we should turn away ALL unvaccinated people from hospital lobbies. Rather, each hospital should dedicate a certain number of beds to these people. It doesn't matter what those patients are there for...if they're not vaccinated, they can only be assigned to these beds, that's it. Once all those beds are occupied, that hospital can then say \"sorry, no more room\" to any prospective unvaccinated patient.\n\nIf anything, having this policy in place might encourage a whole lot more people to go out and get jabbed, simply to ensure they get medical care in the event of an emergency.

I have successfully achieved a religious exemption from the mandate, though it was not without pushback from my end.\n\nNow, being the far-left indoctrination center that UCSC is, my posts in r/ ucsc regarding this subject have been met with intense hate and discrimination regarding my religion and beliefs (ironic, that an institution which \"celebrates\" \"diversity, inclusion and acceptance,\" would in fact have no room for those qualities when it comes to differing perspectives). My posts have been removed, censored, or muted. I thought I would share with this group the kind of content that results in exclusion from a subreddit dedicated to an academic institution, as well as give this text a home. (Note: this is my first post to this subreddit after spending a month or so as an infatuated observer and participant of discussion. I hope this content is permitted).\n\nFrom my original post:\n\n\"I recently created a post regarding religious exemption/exception for the experimental COVID Vaccines being mandated upon the student populace (and I must mention, the mods removed my post with no explanation, and responses in the comments were filled with hate and bigotry). As a Catholic and a human being with the God-given right to personal autonomy, I personally find this mandate absolutely abhorrent. I must make it clear that I am not inherently opposed to vaccines, though I do believe the individual reserves the right to choose what goes into their body and should not be coerced, manipulated or threatened to lose certain rights and abilities based on something such as vaccination status. Let me say that again: *the individual reserves the right to choose what goes into their body and should never be coerced, manipulated or threatened to lose certain rights and abilities based on something such as vaccination status. No matter what.*\n\nThis is not only a deeply held religious belief of mine, but it is in fact the most American belief there is in regards to freedom of personal choice and bodily autonomy. To comply with this mandate would be to surrender ourselves to the most vile government intrusion this nation has observed.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the implementation of covid vaccine mandates across the country and world is leading us, as a global people, to a very dark place. If you've been paying attention, you may have noticed massive anti-\"vaccine passport\" protests rising up across Europe, including in France, Italy, and Lithuania (and now New York City). I applaud these protests. We, as a global people, are actively witnessing or participating in the transformation of a democratic ideal into one of pure authoritarianism, discrimination, hate and tyranny. This global pandemic, which was either leaked or released from a gain-of-function virology laboratory in Wuhan, China, has set a horrid precedent regarding individual liberties and the powers of individuals in government, whether elected or appointed. This virus, the novel covid-19, the seventh known coronavirus to infect man, has become the demise of our great nation. And that is not because of the virus itself, but rather, massive government overreach and over reaction to something that is barely fatal and much less dangerous than it was initially assumed to be. If it isn't apparent to you how covid-19 has been used to control, manipulate, and deceive the American people, I suggest you break free from the cognitive shackles imposed upon you by our national media and government officials. This whole narrative is a farse, they are actively deceiving you to force your compliance.\n\nIt is commonly understood that powers given to governments are powers forever lost to that nation's people. There is extensive literature regarding this phenomena. The post-9/11 Patriot Act is a great example. To this day, illusive government agencies are still spying on the American people, breaching their private lives and evading basic privacy rights. The Patriot Act allowed this imposition upon our people's private lives, and it was passed in 2001. 20 years have passed, and they still continue to neglect our privacy rights in the name of national security. It is clear as day: if we continue to allow these government interventions into our personal lives, the destruction of our civil liberties will continue to persist. Our compliance is our submission. Our submission is our demise.\n\nSo with this, I am pleased to inform the student body at UCSC: religious exemption is possible for those who do not wish to trade their bodily autonomy for the ability to attend higher education. I have gone through the process, successfully, but with some push-back, I must admit. Be prepared to stand up for what you truly believe in, and you will find support through God. Students of UCSC, if you cannot decide whether or not you will take this vaccine, I urge you: look deep inside of yourself. Trust your intuition. Know that behind each corner lies another deception, a trick, an illusion designed to force your will. Resist the narrative. It is the greatest deception many of us have ever witnessed in our entire lives, and it will continue only so long as we comply. This is merely a test. The government has asked for an inch, and they have taken a mile. And they will continue to do so until we find ourselves in complete submission and subservience to their wicked will.\n\nIf you are someone who is considering no longer attending this school due to the mandates imposed by the UC body, please do not hesitate to apply for religious exemption. If you need help through the process, feel free to reach out to me through a PM and I will happily support you through the process.\n\nGod bless America. We are one of the final bastions of freedom in the world. And should we continue to comply with the will of the wicked, we may very well see our beloved nation fall into the grips of authoritarianism; medical-tyranny, so to speak. Have faith, my friends. The fight is not over yet.\"\n\nNow, am I surprised that I was muted and my post removed? Definitely not. Is it a sign of the active attempt to shut down those who speak against this medical tyranny, this ideological hegemony? Absolutely. I am deeply disturbed by the current state of our political and social discourse. As a young man in his early twenties, I must admit that I am quite uncomfortable with the direction our nation and the world is headed. I am also deeply concerned with the willingness of my peer group to conform to the will of the wicked. These are dark times.\n\nMy plans for the future, in regards to higher education, were almost completely de-railed by these mandates. I have seen dozens, if not hundreds of posts in this subreddit by people who face a very similar predicament: *get the jab, or lose your job, your ability to participate in society, and the respect of your peers.* We are not alone. This is affecting hundreds of millions of Americans, and even many more millions of human beings across the world. We must stand up for what we truly believe in, because as far as I am concerned, we are the only thing standing between the state, and full-blown top-down authoritarianism (I refrain from employing the terms fascist or communist here, as I am sure none of us are truly aware as to what the exact qualities and conditions this New World Order will be). The time is now. We are being tested. Hold your will, remain strong. We will resist the New Normal!\n\n(Flared this for Schools, though it could easily be flared as Censorship, Vaccines, Depravity, and more)\n\nEdit: Spelling :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "negative"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "To those with health-themed OCD who are struggling with the Covid vaccine...\nOne of my ongoing OCD themes revolves around health, physical symptoms, and long-term illnesses. When I feel a physical symptom, I have a tendency to ruminate over it and compulsively research, seek reassurance, and otherwise send myself into an anxiety spiral over it.\n\nWhen it was my time to get the COVID vaccine, I signed up for Pfizer right away... and then promptly spent the weeks until my first appointment obsessively googling side effects, visiting subreddits like /r/covidvaccinated, and asking everyone around me about their side effects.\n\nSome of the things I read obviously freaked me out. Comments like:\n\n* \"*Everyone* I know who has gotten the vaccine is still sick from it months later\"\n* \"Here's a news article link to someone who died after getting the vaccine\"\n* \"I've developed X, Y, Z diseases and my doctor said it's from the vaccine\"\n\nI am in no way an anti-vaxxer and I logically knew that a) not everything I was reading was true and b) the chances of very bad side effects were so slim, but I admittedly still almost canceled **both** of my vaccine appointments multiple times.\n\nAnecdotally, my vaccine experience actually went like this:\n\n* First dose: arm pain for about 24 hours\n* Second dose: arm pain, mild muscle aches, and fatigue for about 36 hours\n\nI've been fully vaccinated for several weeks now. My entire family, my friend group, and over 60% of my office is also fully vaccinated. I have never heard a single person in real life complaining of the horrible side effects I read about before getting I got vaccinated. (For reference, my vaccinated family/work/friend group is about 75 people that I know personally).\n\nThe point of this post isn't to say that all of those people are lying (although I'm positive from looking at post history that a significant amount of them are just anti-vaxxers trying to scare people). I know that every vaccine carries a small risk for more serious side effects. \n\nBut the point of this post is just to say that if you're in an OCD spiral over potential vaccine side effects, I see you. You're definitely not alone. Now that I'm fully vaccinated and had such mild side effects, I can't believe I almost canceled my appointments.\n\nI'm proud of each and every one of you who goes through that spike in OCD and anxiety symptoms and overcomes it to protect yourself and your community from this virus because I know how all-consuming those obsessions can be.

This is the  most valuable piece of information on the entire earth at this time.  You need to share this message with everyone. The Harvest is plenty but  the workers are few Luke 10:2. THE FINAL WAR HAS BEGUN.\n\nTHE  COVID-19 VACCINE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST spoken of in The Bible!  technology 666. Covid-19 is a global plan. Part of that plan is the  collapse of the global economy. The Beast spoken about in the Bible is a  system, a satanic organization. These people are called ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœ33rd degree  freemasonsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and they control the entire world, all of the religions, the  media, news, music, movies, and the mainstream narrative. Freemasonry  is an ancient cult of rich white people. The god of freemasonry is  literally Satan from the Bible. The richest people in the world  literally worship Satan. They want to create a new world order, a world  society, each person marked and controllable.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â \n\nThe  vaccine contains a gene editing technology called Cryspr, to change  your DNA. You will never be the same after taking it. It also contains  nanotechnology to connect humans to the Internet and control them. This  is called \"Neural Link\" mind control, using A.I. (artificial  intelligence) supercomputer technology. It will give them ultimate power  over people. To kill them or to control them. This is why they are  installing 5G towers around the world at a rapid rate. 5G speed is  needed to successfully control millions of people. They will turn them  on when more people are vaccinated. BIBLICAL PROPHECY.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â \n\nThe  vaccine also contains a chemical called luciferase which is taken from  fireflies to make you scannable, so they can see who has taken the mark  of the beast vaccine. They are creating the race of Lucifer. It even has  Lucifer's name in it! Anyone who takes this vaccine will go to hell on  judgment day according to the Bible. They even called this thing  Microsoft Patent # 666!\n\n\\-&gt; **Revelation 13:16-18.**  (16) And they cause that all, young and old, rich and poor, free and  prisoner, receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead (17)  And that no person could buy or sell, unless he received the mark, or  the name of the beast, or the number of his name \\[all of these mean  taking the vaccine!\\]. And that eventually all should be killed who  refuse. (18) Here iswisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the  number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s number is  Six hundred sixty six.\n\n\\- The book  of Revelation was created from a dream that John received from ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤Ã‚Â„ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤Ã‚Â‰ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤Ã‚Â„ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¤Ã‚Â€  (Ahayah = I AM) The Most High God.

You will have to take the vaccine in  order to join the new system they are creating. That is why Microsoft  and other software companies are involved in this vaccine. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not a  vaccine.

Control of  thoughts. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s also how they get all of these marked people to fight  Christ when he returns. Revelation 17:14, Joel 3, and Revelation  19:19-21 tells you about that.\n\nRevelation  19:19 = And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their  armies, gathered together to make war against Christ. Revelation 19:20  tells you that people will be deceived into taking the mark of the  beast. Revelation 19:20: And the beast\\[the secret societies that control  the world\\] was taken away, and with him the false prophet\\[the churches  that are telling people to take the vaccine\\] who deceived them that had  received the mark of the beast, were thrown into the lake of fire, hell.  -&gt; people took the vaccine because they did not know it was the mark  of the beast.\n\nRevelation 19:21. =  And the rest of humanity who did not keep GodÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s laws or had the mark of  the beast were killed by Christ, and all the birds of the air were  filled with their flesh. Matthew 24:37 = But as the days of Noah were,  so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Matthew 24:22 = And  except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.  -&gt; If you do some research you will find that there were a lot of  scientific experiments going on by the fallen angels before the flood,  in Noah's day! Genetic modification. -&gt; If you look up the hebrew  words which were translated, the word for flesh = human genetic code.  saved = preserved! What Matthew 24:22 really says is \"except those days  should be shortened, all genetic codes will be tampered with.\"\n\n\\-&gt;  The children of the fallen angels are the ones in power, and they want  to give us their genetic code. Once you inject this stuff into you, you  will never be the same again. Whoever takes the mark of the beast will  be sent to hell on the day of judgement when God judges us. Here is what  the Bible says about people who put their trust in the satanic  weaponized vaccine that satanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s people have created instead of God.\n\n**\\[Romans 6:16\\]**  Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves as servants to obey,  his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of  obedience unto righteousness?\n\n**\\[1 Corinthians 3:16\\]** Know you not that you are the Temple of God, and that The Spirit of God dwelleth in you?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â \n\n**\\[Mark 12:17\\]** And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\n\n**\\[1 Corinthians 6:19-20\\]**  Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is  in you, whom you have received from God? Therefore honor God with your  bodies.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â \n\n**\\[1 Timothy 6:20\\]**  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane  and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â \n\n**\\[1 Corinthians 3:17\\]** If any man defiles the Temple of God, God will destroy him.\n\n\\-  In Genesis, God said that the plants he made were for the healing of  the nations. Is that true or not? Who will you serve? The Satanic  elites, in their news articles and websites on the Internet, are calling  the Covid-19 vaccine \"THE MESSIAH\", and \"OUR ONLY HOPE\". They like to  make fun of Christ and they like to make fun of people. They know that  whoever takes this vaccine will be damned forever. They are celebrating  this great sacrifice of souls to Satan their God.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â \n\nDid  you know that all vaccines contain aborted fetus cells? ABOMINATION.  This Covid-19 vaccine is unlike any other vaccine ever created. This is  actually a software update for humans. As if we were computers. Don't  believe the people on TV, they have an agenda! They are paid readers,  reading from a script! A lot of people have actually DIED from taking  the vaccine! They are trying to hide this fact from us.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â \n\nFreemasons  own the news stations all over the world. They control the dominant  narrative. The groups that have controlled the world for hundreds of  years and thousands of years are: ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe IlluminatiÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. The Rosicrucians.  The Knights Templar. The Skull and Bones Society. Jesuits. Freemasonry.  Zionists. The Order Of The Dragon. These extremely powerful  organizations control the whole world, working for the devil! How do  they do it? They have inserted people into key positions in every  government, organization, corporation, and church.\n\nConclusion:  The COVID-19 vaccine is the mark of the beast .

Of course the virus could evolve, in which case my natural immunity would be just as useless as the immunity I would get from the vaccine. Anyone who has not had Covid I think should feel safe to get vaccinated. If you do come across any story claiming a death or a dangerous side effect, look for the actual number of report cases vs vaccinations.

Had heart palpitations 1st dose.\nFor my first Covid shot (Pfizer), I initially had fatigue, headache, and chills. Later, I developed heart palpitations that was difficult  to deal with, because each episode would incapacitate me. It eventually went away. I contemplated for a long time about the 2nd shot, but eventually took it earlier this week. I am glad to say that the symptoms are more mild than my initial dose. I still dealt with fatigue, headache, and chills but they were more mild and easily managed with acetaminophen. The symptoms disappeared by the 2nd day and arm soreness is nearly nonexistent. The arm soreness lasted for more than a week to 2 weeks for initial time and it was hard to sleep on the side with that arm. \n\nI am describing my 2nd dose experience, because I hope it gives people a bit of hope. Also, I want to add the reason I finally decided to take the 2nd shot (albeit very delayed). Despite being worried and anticipating worse side effects for the 2nd dose, I still felt it was important to completely vaccinate. If I already felt badly for the first shot, I can only imagine how sick I can get with the actual virus. I rather not be in a hospital or be struggling to breathe every breath. The virus is capable of multiplying in the body while immune system struggles to fight the virus off. In the meanwhile, the lungs can become impacted and filled with fluid. COVID can easily make you succumb with pneumonia. To have pneumonia is exhausting for the body and anxiety-inducing because the person is struggling to breathe. The mRNA vaccines only tells the body to make a protein that the COVID-19 virus uses to penetrate and attack our cells. The mRNA is self-limited and does not replicate itself, but the actual virus can. And, it can wreak havoc on the body before the immune system build its own antibodies to fight back. It takes at least a week for the human body to make specific antibodies to the virus. Although there is the innate immune system, the body need the antibodies to fight it off effectively. In the meantime, the virus can cause the person to develop pneumonia or breathing problems to the point that he/she needs a ventilator. What if the ventilator is not enough and the person needs ECMO? There is not many ECMO machines in the state and even taking the drastic measure does not guarantee recovery.\n\nJust something to think about. \nOverall, COVID-19 can cause lung complications and other things. The vaccine gives a chance for the body to recognize it before you face the actual virus. When you do, it does not need a week or more to build the specific antibodies to fight it off. \n\nAlso, there is data to show that can reduce transmission. Any percentage to reduce spreading to others is also helping your family, friends, or people that you give a care for.\n\nI wish everyone well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "positive"}]}

Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\n\nThe problem is, this gene therapy does not introduce a an agent that resembles the disease. It uses mRNA proteins to code your body into producing antigens that then cause the body to produce antibodies. This is the first time in human history this has ever been done. It is NOT a vaccine, and the more you refuse to call it that the more people may start to understand the skepticism behind it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why you should care about NOT having a vaccine passport\nI'm a computer engineer and have always closely followed privacy issues, and **the vaccination passport is a very scary prospect for our privacy and freedom**, maybe in more ways than you would think on the surface. I have been seeing some misconceptions in comments about ways to cheat the system, but they are way ahead of you on those.\n\nUnfortunately it is something that was probably going to happen someday regardless of a virus or not, particularly after the Chinese implemented social credit. The vaccine is used just as an excuse at this point. Personally I wouldn't even mind the vaccine after waiting some time for long-term data, but the tracking that comes with a passport is unacceptable, and that is what we should be fighting.\n\nSomething I think should be clear is that there are two different, separate issues here, and they are both valid. The first is not wanting to take the vaccine. This is a valid standpoint, but basically solely an ethics question and a separate debate. The second is **not wanting to present identification when entering all/a lot/some businesses**, and this is the one I will talk about. The media/politicians will try to lump both together, but they are very distinct issues.\n\nTechnically the only thing you need to know is that you will have a barcode/QR code/ID number (doesn't even matter if it's on your phone or on a paper), and the place that you are entering has a digital scanner (a human checking papers is too easy to fool/too slow), so they are way ahead on that. To be able to admit you, your code has to be checked against a server-stored token, to prove your passport is legitimate.\n\nWhenever a request is performed against the server, it follows a log will be produced of that identification request. Something like \"Mr John Smith, at Walmart SW LA, 03/03/2021, 3:15pm, does he have a vaccine/negative test/etc.?\", to which the server replies \"yes/no\".\n\nNow all kinds of web servers produce some sort of log, maliciously or not, but you will never be able to tell whether the system you are using does it or not. And given that a chain of web servers interact with each other on modern architectures, and logging is a default on modern (or old for that matter) programs, it's a given someone will do it.\n\nMy objective with this post is to clear some confusion around what you could do to cheat the system, or to counter some arguments software agencies and health officials have been propagating. I'm not targeting any system in particular, but I'm attacking the system architecture that is being proposed, using the arguments I would use if someone pitched me a new system and I played the devil's advocate.\n\nDiscussing misconceptions/workarounds I have seen:\n\n- \"**I'll use a paper one**\": Irrelevant. As long as the code is read by a machine, that machine will have to consult a server, to where your ID is sent. This is not a \"disable your location services\" kind of system, the tracking is done by the scanning party. No scanner? Maybe the clerk just types a number on his phone, same thing from a privacy standpoint, your ID is sent somewhere out of your control. Given that the trend is to replace human agents with machines (ticket control, store assistants, etc) I hardly believe we will see a new human-based job appearing. It will be like scanning your ticket at the train station.\n\n- \"**I'll get a fake passport**\": Could work only if the store/gate agent/whatever didn't have a digital scanner, and only looked at papers (knowing that this is cumbersome, and they know there will be cheaters, this will not be the case). If the verification is done on the server side nothing short of hacking that server would help you, and even then your \"life log\" could have already been backed up somewhere. \"Things on the internet last forever\" is true, in the sense that even if you delete something, you have no way of knowing if someone has saved a copy.\n\n- \"**I'll share my passport with my friends to confuse them**\": The owner's photo might be stored on their server, and that will appear on their scanner, thus showing you are not the owner to a nearby agent/AI face recognition system (not sci-fi, and at this point in time, the system could evolve into being just a camera on their end that could check you are indeed vaccinated and hence track you, no need to even have a paper).\n\n- \"**I'll get my doctor friend to forge an exemption**\": Sure, you can escape the vaccine, but you still have to present your \"exempt\" passport, hence you are tracked just as anyone else. Same logic for negative tests, or for someone who was already infected. You are still an ID being associated with places. Should the purpose of the system be to track you, then it doesn't matter whether you have a vaccine or not, just that you comply with mandatory identification.\n\n- \"**The scanner does not contact any server, my QR code has a verifiable signed token that the scanner reads locally**\": Theoretically fine, but how can you be sure the scanner does what the government/ID provider tells you it does? Maybe it just stores your credentials locally for in-store tracking (the same way a store card would), but do you want that to be legally mandated? Maybe it shares them with some related companies for marketing. The point is if you do not know what the other party is doing, you do not participate. The best way for your nudes not to leak on the internet is not sharing them in the first place.\n\n- \"**The passport does not have my name associated**\": You know bitcoin? It's paraded as the private currency. It's not controlled by any government. Yet, the police has been able to arrest people by using inference attacks. These sort of attacks are very powerful, it is detective work but on a digital scale. Maybe to the passport you are just \"John Doe\", but you are the John Doe that checks-in every day to workplace X, that goes every week to Starbucks Y at a small town, that goes every month to state Z. It's not hard for law enforcement to then go around and find out who you are if they know your routine. You have nothing to hide? Until you are in the wrong place at the wrong time again.\n\n- \"**The government would not do such a thing, they care only about health**\": Let's suppose it is so. There is still a system that is capable of logging your whereabouts. And no system in the world is perfectly safe. Let's say it gets hacked. Now your life data is somewhere on the dark web being sold to the highest bidder. Maybe some house thiefs noticed that today you checked-in at a shop 1000 miles away from your workplace. The data is anonymized? Lets go back to the inference attacks. If the police is able to do it, so are hackers. And a database of life itself surely is a prime target for attacks.\n\n- \"**I really trust my friend's hacking skills**\": No system is perfect, so hacking it will be possible. But it's only a matter of time until your exploit gets fixed, so it will always be a game of cat and mouse. It's much easier for data to be stolen from the server as in the point above, since that attack only needs temporary access to the server.\n\n- **\"We are already tracked everywhere\"**: Sure. Visa tracks you. Mastercard as well. Facebook. Google. Your phone provider. But each has their own system. The police can request data from each one of them, which is a bureaucratic process. Banking in particular has old systems. And it's not all put together neatly in a system built from the ground up, where a simple query can show everything a given person has done throughout his life. And all of the former are opt-in too.\n\n- **\"Vaccination passports already exist\"**: Come on, you are really telling me you have always shown a vaccination passport to buy groceries, to go to the cinema or for interstate travel? Might have been so to go to 4 or 5 African countries, nothing more.\n\n- **\"I have nothing to hide\"**: Until whatever you did that was legal and allowed is not anymore. Royalty and even landowners in general had nothing to hide in Russia until 1917. Plus you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time and be accused of something you did not do. Maybe you checked in to to a restaurant and a supermarket the same day as a suspect, and the police wrongly put 2 and 2 together. And if they tell you it is private, it's a matter of time until someone decides it is not.\n\nIt's still soon to know implementations of the passport, and how often or where it will be used (international travel vs buying groceries). But knowing how a system is designed, and regardless of the \"privacy level\" they are parading, there will always be a lot of flaws on the concept itself. And forcing people to abdicate their privacy in every aspect of daily life, for whatever reason, is just appalling and downright unethical.\n\nWe need to shift the focus away from this being about the vaccine, and focusing on it being about tracking. Could have happened just as well after 9/11 if the tech was there. I know most people will cave in when they are told that they will not get a job without the passport, or won't be able to buy food. Unless we are aware of the ramifications of such a system, and go outside to protest or boycott it. Because once it's accepted it is not going anywhere. And remember, a vaccination tracking system is, first of all, a tracking system.\n\n**TLDR:** Don't try to beat the covid tracking system, you need to prevent it from ever existing in the first place\n\n#I did not write this, original user deleted their account and I felt with covid passports still in the news cycle it was time to repost this -- **[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lx0qlg/why_you_should_care_about_not_having_a_vaccine/)**"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "negative"}]}

If you are able to get the vaccine and you choose not to, you are not only hurting yourself, but people around you.\n\nLet's start off by saying there is 0 supported evidence that the vaccine causes a permanent spike in Tinnitus. When you receive the vaccine, your immune system is essentially going into a higher productive state to develop antibodies that protect you from covid replicating inside your body. Due to your body working harder, you could temporarily perceive your Tinnitus to be louder, just like when you get a cold or allergies. But that is completely temporary. \n\nI'm not going to say there aren't fringe cases that people develop long term ringing in their ears due to some poor reaction, as there are a small amount of people that are allergic to vaccines or other reasons. But that is a very rare population of people. There also may be other reasons such as increased anxiety or stress over it.\n\nJust like any subreddit, these fringe cases are going to be highlighted, and unfortunately it scares a lot of people.\n\nAlso, it is important to note there ARE significant amounts of reports of people developing long term Tinnitus from GETTING COVID. https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201106/covid-may-cause-tinnitus\n\nYou almost have only 2 choices. Getting the vaccine that has a very high success rate and no evidence of Tinnitus specifically as a side effect, or battling covid which has shown to be dangerous. Getting the vaccine not only protects you, but people around you from getting sick. Please get the vaccine if you can\n\nIf you are worried you should speak to your doctor as I'm not giving true medical advice"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "positive"}]}

COVID-19 Misinformation and Disinformation is what is killing the world and society.**\n\nWhy? Why do people still continue to believe in lies and not the actual reality? Why do they care more about their feelings and false reality instead of listening to the facts from professionals? Do they realize that it's like most diseases that are real? Why do they disregard this one in particular as a \"fake\" or \"bio-weapon\"? Why do they hate to look at the other side that debunks everything they say? Why after all these days of the pandemic, still don't care about it at all? Why are they so hell bent on human rights when they know human rights need to be modified in cases of a worldwide crisis? Why?\n\nCOVID is real, the vaccine works, everything about it has been backed up for eons since this god damn pandemic started.\n\nThey were given every opportunity to listen to the WHO and CDC and other related government health groups. However they disregard that because they were \"corrupted\" by oh no \"FORIEGN DEEP STATE INTERESTS LOL\". If they were does that deny what they researched is true? Every single report about everything has been proven to debunk your crazy ass theories, but after all that, you still cling on to your false disinformation.\n\nThis pandemic has been a worldwide effort, every single god damn country helped to fight the virus. You cared more about disregarding actual truths because of that for your own corrupted version of freedom.\n\nI'm sorry but they are the ones who will end the world and end the value of civility in democracy and civil discourse in the world.They are the same people that tried to end America because they lost, tried to ban an app to eliminate the First Amendment of Free Speech (TikTok) that the CIA and other top researchers of the world proved it's harmless because they can't handle the criticisms of their president thanks to TikTok's userbase and 4chan cooperating in on it, are hypocrites by supporting police that fits their agenda because oh no when the capitol police served justice to the terrorists back in January they decry that, and tried to eliminate history and the actual reality by making up some bullshit boogyman called CRT to suppress the truth we taught to our kids for decades.\n\nThey also cared more about some stupid Twitch PogChamp emote being banned to downplay the January 6th terrorist attack all over Twitter.And they have the g'all to be called pro-lifers?

If you are trying to abuse my story to promote your anti-vaxx propaganda, you can go \\*\\*\\* yourself.\n\nJust happened an hour ago, I'm still trying to process it.\n\nSo, I went to a local vaccination center to get my first COVID vaccine. It's this big hall, everything organized very professionally, military guards, hundreds of people being processed. I line up, everything easy, short chat with the medical personnel, everything in order, they sit me down, I get the injection, no biggie. Then I am asked to go sit in this common hall with a bunch of other people for observation. I can leave after 10 minutes they say.\n\nSo I sit down, take my phone, browse Reddit, you know, the usual stuff to kill some time. Then I realize that I am a bit dizzy. Just a little bit, not a big deal, so I brush it off. As time goes on though, I am getting more and more dizzy. I start thinking that I might have an allergic reaction or something. After 10 minutes I am *very* dizzy and my heart is racing like crazy. So I get the attention of the nearby medical personnel and tell them I don't feel that good. They ask if I want to talk to a doctor. Yeah, maybe I say. We'll fetch a wheelchair they say. Oh, there is no need, I reply, I can walk. So I stand up and... kind of crash to the ground. Not a real fall but my legs don't hold me that well. I am really dizzy now, my stomach is all stone, and I start getting these weird electrical shocks though my body. Ugh, not good, I catch myself thinking.\n\nThey pick me up, put me in the wheelchair and rush me to the emergency room, with roughly a hundred puzzled and worried mostly elderly people looking on (for reference, I am close to 2 meters tall guy in my mid 30-s, so it must have looked a bit weird). I am on a medical bed and I feel *reallyreally* crappy, there is a huge weight on my chest and I have difficulty breathing. They are hooking me to a bunch of medical machines. My life is flashing in front of my eyes. What a crappy way to go I think and wait for the seemingly inevitable premature demise to come.\n\n\"Your blood pressure is really low, but the heart is in perfect condition\" ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” I hear the doctor say. Wait, what? So I am not dying? She laughs. \"No, you are fine, probably just an overreaction of the autonomic nervous system\". Oh. The pressure from my chest suddenly disappears, I just feel very weak and quite embarrassed. So I'm ok? \"Pretty much in great shape yeah, just a bit low blood pressure, its fairly common reaction to seeing a needle. Did you eat anything today?\". Oh, I think, shouldn't have skipped that breakfast and lunch probably. The feeling of impending doom is quickly replaced by the feeling of extreme embarrassment. I am not having an anaphylactic shock or a heart attack. I am just having an anxiety attack from being pricked by a needle in an unfamiliar environment. Awkward.\n\nTwenty minutes later they escort me out of the building, joking about how they are thankful for having a reason to actually do something instead of standing around all day. I am super red, bowing in the best of the Japanese fashion (I am neither Japanese nor this was in Japan) and apologizing like crazy. They wink me good bye and tell me \"see you in four weeks\". I go grab some sweets and drinks, feeling like a massive idiot.\n\nP.S. A bit shoutout for the medical team for their professionalism, kindness and a great sense of humor. They really did an amazing job and I was deeply impressed about how calm and efficient they stayed though the entire episode. You ladies and gentlemen rock!\n\nP.P.S.

I also tried to post the story multiple times since I had an issue with the bot auto-rejecting my post for formatting issues.\n\nTL;DR got my vaccine shot, had a surprise light vasovagal reaction (sudden blood pressure drop because of anxiety), interpreted it as an allergic reaction to the vaccine itself, which triggered a massive panic attack. Thought I was dying, got wheeled away by the on-duty doctor team, who proceeded to poke friendly jokes at me.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I’m a university student who experienced a legal win against my university. I made a comment on a post a few days ago, and got so many responses that I decided to make a thread detailing how I got out of the mandate via religious exemption\nBrief background: I got to Loyola Chicago, which was technically allowing exemptions, but not “accepting” any. I sent over seven different attempts this summer, and all were rejected with no reason given. A group of students was able to get in contact with Liberty Counsel, an Evangelical legal non-profit. I sent the attorney all of my correspondence with Loyola, and the letter of mine that they used to include me in their a case against Loyola was as follows (the other letters have worked for my friends at other universities, but for those facing strict mandates, Liberty Counsel easily worked with this letter) :\n\n\nMy personal religious beliefs prohibit the injection of foreign substances into my body. The Bible teaches that we shall keep the blood pure, and keep the seed from being mixed. When genetic materials from bacteria, viruses, yeast, animals, birds, and other humans are injected during vaccination, the blood is contaminated, and genetic changes occur. God warned against this. To do so would violate the teachings of the Bible. My objection to this vaccination is based on my deeply held religious beliefs. \n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations, while not using morally compromised cell lines in the  design, development, or production of the vaccine, utilized a confirmatory test employing the morally compromised HEK293 cell line in order to test the efficacy of both vaccines. The HEK-293 cell line is derived from human embryonic kidney cells harvested from an aborted fetus.  Thus, both vaccines are connected to the initial evil of abortion by utilizing fetal tissue in the testing process, and to take either vaccine would support the belief that abortion is acceptable, a belief that strongly contradicts my deeply held religious convictions. \n\nThe AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination are even more morally compromised. The HEK-293 cell line was used in the design, development, and production stages of the AstraZeneca  vaccine, as well as for confirmatory testing.  The PER.C6 cell line, which was developed using retinal cells from an 18-week-old aborted fetus, was used in the design, development, and production stages of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as well as for confirmatory testing.  \n\nMy personal religious beliefs hold abortion to be against the will of God. “Thou shalt not kill”, Scripture tells us in Exodus 20:13.\n\nI would like to point out at this time that the official Vatican position on COVID-19 vaccines can be found in its entirety here, and states:\n    5. At the same time, practical reason makes evident that vaccination is not, as a rule, a moral obligation and that, therefore, it must be voluntary. In any case, from the ethical point of view, the morality of vaccination depends not only on the duty to protect one's own health, but also on the duty to pursue the common good. In the absence of other means to stop or even prevent the epidemic, the common good may recommend vaccination, especially to protect the weakest and most exposed. Those who, however, for reasons of conscience, refuse vaccines produced with cell lines from aborted fetuses, must do their utmost to avoid, by other prophylactic means and appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles for the transmission of the infectious agent. In particular, they must avoid any risk to the health of those who cannot be vaccinated for medical or other reasons, and who are the most vulnerable.\n\nI Corinthians 6:19 tells us that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit.

PCR tests are being revoked by the CDC as they are unable to differentiate between viruses. The method and reference standard developed for this assay was bunk to begin with.\n2. **Misattributed Deaths:** if you go to hospital for *any reason,* you get tested for covid. If you test positive (highly flawed, remember!)  and then go on to die for *any reason* with 28 days of that test, you get put down as a with covid death. This is demonstrated on the CDC website, where they state that only 5% of people died *from covid*, rather than with it. Hospitals have been paid more per covid-related death in many parts of the world.\n3. **Cases, cases, cases:** Media driven bullshit and fear mongering through \"high case numbers\", once again drive by... flawed testing. Results are meaningless without a solid testing method and reference standard. This is chemistry 101.\n4. Faulty testing has been used to drive a casedemic, with most policies that are being mandated being tied directly to this fraudulent testing methodology. \n\nB) The response the the virus has been grossly exaggerated. \n\n1. Masks don't work to protect you against viruses. I don't care what you \"think\" you know. If you work with masks or as an RT, you know I'm right. Most of you have never worn a mask in your life prior to 2020. Stop believing a piece of fabric that is not properly fitted to your face (with no space for air to enter or escape other than through filters and egress valves), is going to protect you. It absolutely is not. Drop this fucking nonsense already.\n2. Lockdowns, travel restrictions, isolation, and quarantining of people who *have tested negative for the virus,* is ridiculous*.* Even if you test positive, *the tests are entirely flawed.* Asymptomatic? You're probably not even infected. These are psychological measures put in place to distance people from each other. \n3. People are being instructed not to talk to each other in Australia. They may be spreading misinformation when they open their mouths.\n4. People are told to ONLY believe what the government tells them in New Zealand. Unless it comes from the gov, it's not true. The unquestionable truth. This same rhetoric is making it's way around the world in various forms.\n5. Quarantine for \"vaccinated\" people, is ridiculous. Wearing a mask if you are \"vaccinated\", is ridiculous.\n6. Denial of acquired and cross-immunity is ridiculous. They are actively denying multiple antibody tests for the same patient. If you are in this camp, you may as well be telling us the world is flat. You are nothing more than a dunce. We have known this to be true for our entire lives. It's the *best* defense we have.\n\nC) The vaccine is not a vaccine, nor is it safe.\n\n1. It does not prevent infection. It does not prevent transmission. It does not prevent death. It *may* lessen your symptoms. This may be the worst \"vaccine\", ever.\n2. If it was effective, \"vaccinated\" people would not need any kind of guidelines or restrictions. Instead, the are still getting sick and dying in larger and larger numbers, and being met with the same kind of restrictions as the un\"vaccinated\".\n3. Freak accidents post \"vaccination\" are growing. We know many famous people who have suffered issues and death all over the world. This is unlike any vaccine in history, and the instances don't appear to be slowing down. If anything, they are becoming more frequent.\n4. As you may have guessed from the first point, you can still catch and transmit the virus - but because you now may have less symptoms, you have higher chance of transmitting the spike proteins to someone else if you are sick.\n5. This isn't a vaccine.\n6. Millions of people affected with side-effects at this stage. Tens of thousands are dead as a result of the shot.\n7. People seem to always \"get covid\" soon after getting their \"vaccines\", all while they managed to avoid it for the 16 months prior. Interesting.\n8. Doctors are diagnosing people with Bell's Palsy 30 minutes after \"vaccination\", and then telling those same people that it is entirely unrelated, and they should get the 2nd shot because it is safe. Completely measured and normal response, of course.\n9. This isn't a vaccine.\n10. Treatments are been entirely ignored. Fuck, treatment polices are not even being proposed. \"Stay home until you get really ill.\" People are being gaslight through the media, through politics, through fact-checker shills, and through idiot politicians. There are 30 RCTs on Ivermectin *proving* it is effective. It has been on the market for 40 years. It is incredibly safe. It is also very effective at preventing and treating this virus. Yet, *no one in the media is talking about it.* It's almost as if they don't want you to even be aware of an alternative treatment - you know, one that actually works. Instead, it remains in a perpetual state of \"we need more evidence.\" The fuck we do.\n11. Most people that have died from covid (delta) in the UK over the past 6 months were vaccinated. 66% of them, in fact.\n12. Every single day, more and more medical experts are speaking out, giving testimonies, and sharing their experiences which completely contradict all the lies and gaslighting in the media, and confirming the things others are sharing. Every single person who goes against the narrative goes through character assassination, without fail. This is no coincidence.\n13. This isn't a vaccine - it's a potential death sentence.\n\nIf you haven't noticed that something is very wrong at this stage, you need to WAKE THE FUCK UP. We are sounding the alarm bells. What do we need to do to make you realize that something is very wrong here?\n\nYou know damn well things don't make logical sense. None of the measures make sense. It's all utter nonsense.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "3 Rules/laws that could help us move on past COVID-19\nIn recent weeks the governmentâ€™s failings in combatting COVID-19 has been increasingly evident. As such I came up with 3 simple rules/laws which the Government could easily enforce (if they wished to), which would reduce deaths, reduce hospital workload and reduce fear.\n\n1. Make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory: \n\nSingapore is known internationally for imposing strict laws to maintain order, quite often with minimal positive impact to the general population. Therefore it is shocking to me that we have not made COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory, this would reduce deaths, reduce hospital workload and allow us to return to normal faster. So few unvaccinated people remain, yet they make up the vast majority of cases in our hospital and ICU beds. If there was ever a time to be draconian in imposing laws, it is now. Vaccines save lives, it is evident from the data both locally and globally, the alternative is to continue to be hostages to worst members of our society. If these people refuse, well then the fines can begin, if that is not enough, we should escalate further. *Note: those unable to be vaccinated due to health/medical reasons would obviously be exempt from this, but measures should be put in place to ensure anti-vaxxers donâ€™t try to utilise this avenue to escape vaccination.*\n\n2. Turn non-urgent cases away from hospitals (and even GPs):\n\nWe have been spoilt by our healthcare services over the years, to the point where going to the GP or even A&amp;E for the mildest reason is the norm. Most other countries do not have this attitude, if you turn up to A&amp;E without valid reason for being there you are turned away. While I realise this goes against much of how our healthcare system has operated in the past, if we are not more selective in who comes into hospitals they will begin implode. Many healthcare workers have already noted that too many mild cases are turning up to hospital, expecting to be treated. These people should be turned away and in egregious cases given a clear warning regarding their behaviour. This simple action will help further reduce the burden on the healthcare system.\n\n3. Stop regular testing:\n\nFear has been the key driver in the above issue. Over the past year the government has used fear of COVID-19 as a mechanism to ensure compliance to any rules that have been implemented. The reality is that those whose who are vaccinated have a lower risk of death when compared to the flu. If we donâ€™t change how we perceive COVID-19 in a post vaccine world we will continue to be trapped by it. Reducing regular testing will help take away the spectre of fear that is currently over us all. Some might say that allowing the continued spread of COVID-19 unchecked may lead to new variants, this is true. However, to combat this fully would require a COVID zero approach globally, which will never happen, meaning there is little we can do to stop any evolution (though it should be stated that most viruses evolve over time to be more infectious and less deadly, as a dead host means a dead virus). At least if we stop regular testing the fear enshrined in our minds will slowly begin to dissolve.\n\nPlease do let me know if you have any comments or you think there are some flaws (major or minor) in these ideas. I just hope this starts a discussion which hopefully pushes us in a safer direction. Because as long as our healthcare workers are overwhelmed and anti-vaxxers are still present, none of us are truly safe, either from COVID-19 or other medical ailments that we are not able to get proper attention for.

You can already see the difference, and as a percentage that’s 3%. There’s a massive difference between 0.1% and 3%. \n\nEven when you look at the 7 day averages you see the same trend. The current 7 day trend is an average of 46,358 cases and 136 deaths, which is 0.3 %. Last year end of November it was 15, 970 and 486 deaths, which is again 3%. \n\nFurthermore, the age group with the highest amount of cases is those in year 7 - 11 (roughly aged 11 - 16), and those of that age group aren’t at a very high risk. And also in a few weeks numbers will further decrease as now school children over the age of 12 are now getting vaccinated.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, forgot to mention this, but I still highly encourage people to wear masks"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "positive"}]}

Honestly I see bad with the vaccine and without it catching covid. Monkeys in the SARS cov 1 trials, were fine until they had their second vaccine, but when they caught covid, they had something called anti body dependent enhancement. Which killed even the healthy monkeys who if they hadn't had the jab, wouldn't have died. And if you look on the gov site, this vaccine hasn't been fully rolled out until 2024. \n\nSo the only real concern I have, is if there is a delay with anti body dependant enhancement. Don't get me wrong I'm no scientist. There have been people getting blood clots after the Pfizer as well. This vaccine passport roll out in the UK, I feel is an invasion of human rights. If people want to risk catching covid by not having the vaccine and going clubbing, let them do so. It's their choice. \n\nBut Borris saying you can't enter unless you have both, I personally think it's forceful and disgusting. Some people don't want to risk their lives. It is still in experimental faze. I've had mine because, even though the death rates on covid is only 1%, that is still enough people to populate entire countries. And 1 out of 10 people (I worked it out to be 1 out of 4 going by the other fact of, half of the survives), but apparently 1 out of 10 people that catch covid develop something called long covid, which can lead to things like stroke, heart attack, and even brain damage. And people report (covid brain) quite often, which is where people literally can't talk they slur for weeks after covid.\n\nSo my choice because covid is rife in hospitals with mainly people without the jab at the moment, dying according to Dr's I follow online, I would rather have the vaccines, especially because I am not the healthiest person.

Remember these guys aren't liable if they screw up either. \n\n-If the side effects and risks are low and of no concern, why are we asked to conduct covid surveys to document if there we have any post jab symptoms? Yet the media seems to always brush things off as NBD. If side effects are in fact a risk, then I have to ask myself, which is worst, the possible long term side effects driven directly by the shot or catching the Rona and being in bed for a week, also with the possibility of long term health damages. \n\n- Usually before taking other jabs they ask if you're allergic to any of the ingredients in the meds, not with COVID shot, it's mandatory \n\n- I have this aching feeling in my mind telling me the Covid/VAX was intentionally released by USA/China.

It is dangerous. \n\n\"Oh it's just the flu\" \n\nYes, its base symptoms are identical to that of the flu. But that's not all it does, it makes later or even present issues so much worse. This is common knowledge. \n\n\"It was created by whoever for whatever\" \n\nThis one always makes me laugh, for a few reasons. First, it was a scam to get Rump out of office. Well, he's out and guess what? It's still fucking here you God damn idiots. \n\nWhile I personally lack the proper understanding to post directly how it was made, man made or natural in the end it wasn't a ploy by the government, you're just paranoid or want some form of an excuse to go against the government so you can feel like a wittle badass in an uprising while you're too unhealthy to run a mile without passing out!\n(The ending was a personal one for me) \n\n\"The vaccine was made too quickly! It messes your DNA! It has 5g data!\" \n\nFirst off, to people who came here to hear my rant, I wish this was a joke. People actually believe this. First off, making the vaccine as quickly as people did is is nothing short of a miracle.again referencing the fact that I don't fully understand the science, since I'm not a doctor or medical professional, I do trust what they have to say:\nmRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine. They don't use live virus to trigger an immune response. Instead, they teach your cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response. Once triggered, your body makes antibodies. These antibodies help you fight the infection if the real virus does enter your body in the future.\n\nIt doesn't alter your DNA so just stop. \n\nMy favourite one, and again I'm not joking people actually believe this, that the vaccine is affected by 5g signals and that's why it can make you magnetic. \nTo better explain, check this link posted by McGill University\nhttps://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/covid-19/can-vaccines-make-our-body-magnetic\n\nIt's actually kinda funny. \n\n\"Well horse dewormer-\" \n\nNo. Just...no. yes, a variation of the drug can be used by humans to treat parasitic infections but why in the fuck would you take a medicatjon that 1. Isn't prescribed to you and 2. That has no actual proof through the FDA that it cures Covid? \n\nFuck if it did it'd be a lot easier don't you think? \n\n\"Oh well they just don't want us to get back to normal\" \n\nAre you fucking stupid? Well, yes probably, but I'll tell you something special.\n\nEVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS GOING THROUGH THIS!\n\nI mean shit we can't even get along on a regular basis do you honestly think that every country, every enemy or rival or whatever you want to ca it country has the capability to get along and agree to say \n\" You know what's a great idea?

Yeah, I'll put tinfoil on the shopping list. \n\nLet's see, what else. \n\nOh yeah. \n\nIf you're curious about Covid or its treatment and want to make a claim about it then do exactly this:\n\n1. Go to your local doctor and ask.\n\n2. In the extreamly unlikely event that they state the vaccine is fake or whatevermake sure they have viable proof, confirmed by other accredited doctors who actually attended medical school.\n\n3. Record their statements, documents, etc and post this online. \n\nOh and lastly, if you're worried about the CO2 from your mouth going back into your nose or whatever, heh then you don't want to know how much CO2 is in the air we breathe. \nPlus, doctors have been wearing surgical masks for decades.

The anticipation anxiety was much worst than the experience itself.\n I have a phobia of needles, and a bunch of other irrational fears and anxieties over all of this. \nSo this took a lot out of me. \nI did have a mini panic attack afterwards when they told me to wait 10 mins, I got really hot and sweaty but I managed to tell myself ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœthis is NOT an allergic reaction, or anything like that. This is your anxiety trying to tell you to think it is. This is a symptom of anxiety itself and nothing moreÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and it went away immediately. \nNormally, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d panic harder thinking physical symptoms arenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t related to my anxiety. \nYou have to remind yourself the physical things your body can do when youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re having anxiety, anxiety attacks, and panic attacks.\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve had these feelings before with taking an unknown medication, or anything new like this. I just internally panic and idk why. \n\nI am trying to be stronger than who my anxiety is making me out to be. I often look back at the times I worried myself physically sick, and had massive anticipation anxiety over something, and probably 9.9 times out of 10 there was NOTHING to worry about. It was all fine. And in the case the thing that I was worried about did happen, it was less severe than it was to be worrying about it. \nIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m trying to remind myself of this! \nAnxiety is not helping me! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s usually not warning me of something dangerous! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s overworked because itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s part of my mental illness. But we can learn to overcome it and manage it, and hopefully be stronger than we ever were. \n\nThank you again to everyone helping me through my anxiety of getting vaccinated. \nIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m so happy I finally did this, and I am sorry I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t do this sooner. \nItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s the next day for me and so far, I experienced just a sore arm and fatigue. I am aware that side effects could still happen, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m also reminding myself that it may not, and that if it does itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll all be okay. \nIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m telling my anxiety to not overreact and anticipate the worst, as it usually does. What is done is done.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m also going to take a break from reading the scary parts of the internet. I know I should be smarter to know not to fall victim to that stuff, but they still scare me. And scaring me is not going to benefit me right now. \nI hate that the world is so against each other right now. It honestly breaks my heart to just simply be on the internet sometimes. \n\nThank you so much to everyone here. You guys made me cry happy tears to just see such a supportive caring side of the internet. \nYou guys helped me step into what I feel is the right direction. \nThank you thank you thank you!!! \n\nTLDR: with the help of everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s support here, I finally faced my fears of needles, and other related anxieties of getting the vaccine. \nI revered my vaccine yesterday and so far everything went completely fine.

It's not meant to scare anyone but to help others navigate the process.\n\nI'm male, in my 30s, diagnosed in my early 20s. I got my first vaccination in April, and the second one in May. After both shots, I had mild symptoms like tiredness and muscle pain. After two weeks, I got my antibodies checked because I was aware that Gilenya might interfere with the vaccination.\n\nUnfortunately, I developed almost no antibodies, most likely because of the medication. Antibodies are only an indicator for immunity, but after two months I grew a bit impatient and got a T-cell-response-test which was negative, too.\n\nLast week, me and my neurologist decided to give a third vaccination shot a try. It's not really clear if this counts as a booster shot or just a new try. He also said that some of his Gilenya-patients did indeed have a response after the second shot, which was not the full antibody count, but still enough to assume a certain level of protection.\n\nSo if you're a Gilenya patient and in doubt, please consult your neurologist to discuss this issue.

I just don't understand HOW someone can look at the numbers, look at the data, and still not want to put in the zero effort to wear a piece of fucking cloth on their face for 10 minutes to walk into a store. It's so FUCKING annoying. I've listened to the CDC and their guidances, and I've been fully vaccinated for about a month now, but it all feels in vein. I no longer wear a mask unless I have to since the CDC says full-vaccinated individuals can forego masks (except in certain cases like public transportation and local business policies). However, some idiots are taking it as if they have an excuse now to not wear a mask. My mom, who I love with all my heart, is victim to Facebook's \"they're putting microchips in the vaccines, you're just a lab rat\" type shit. Or like, in my History class a few days ago a classmate of mine said that we can't trust the people who made the vaccines since we don't know what they put in them. And in the nicest way possible I was like \"Well, the ingredients for the three main vaccines are listed on the CDC's website.\" And she was like \"How do you know they're not lying? Were you there when they made it?\" HOLY SHIT! These people want to be smarter than others and special SO BAD! Was I there? No. Do I still question what I'm told? Yes. Does that mean I'm gonna give in to these dumbass conspiracy theories that vaccines prevent you from having children or something? HELL NO! Half a million deaths and counting from this illness, and people STILL don't take it seriously. \"You know you're basically a lab rat and the vaccines haven't been approved by the FDA, right?\" Firstly, they have, at least partially. And secondly, if being a lab rat means we can get back to normal and prevent any more people from dying, I'm ok with that. \"But they have microchips in them that track you.\" Motherfucker, you have a phone, right? They're already tracking you, and that's been PROVEN (thanks Edward Snowden). So what difference does it make? \"But they give you Autism/AIDS/Turn you Gay.\" They don't give you Autism, the study in the 90s that claimed that has been debunked hundreds of times, and the majority of scientists who worked on it refuted their own statements years later. And as someone on the Autism spectrum, I find it disgusting saying you'd rather risk your child's well-being than have an autistic child. They don't give you AIDS/HIV and don't contain Mercury, Embryos, or anything like that. The mercury they USED to use was very small and couldn't hurt you, and no, they don't have embryos or live viruses that can hurt you. And \"Turn you gay\"? Seriously? It's 2021, grow the fuck up and log off of Facebook once in a while. Once again, as someone who isn't completely straight, it's insulting that people would rather possibly die than be \"turned\" gay.\n\nI'm just fearful of what the future has in store, and I don't want people to die.

Normal immune reactions include low-grade fever, aches, etc that subside after a couple days.\n\nI didn't love how that felt, but the alternative is possibly dying on a ventilator while facetiming your family, developing long-term lung disease or blood clots after having Covid, having a tube shoved down your throat and getting hospital acquired pneumonia, Cdiff, or MRSA from being in the hospital, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and all the side effects of the meds as well.....

The reactions that some people are having are in all likelihood the body's response to being exposed to aspects of the virus itself which the vaccines emulate.  In other words the people that are susceptible to adverse reactions to the vaccines are in all likelihood susceptible to far worse reactions from infection with the virus itself because the viral load is far higher in that case than the emulated viral load the vaccines provide.\n\nSo thank your lucky stars if you've had a vaccine, have had any kind of adverse reaction and are still alive because you in all likelihood would have experienced far worse consequences from becoming infected with covid-19 itself... and make no mistake everyone will become infected by covid-19 at some point because the vaccines don't prevent transmission.\n\nIf you happen to be one of the few who are susceptible to severe illness, your chances of survival or avoidance of permanent organ damage are far better if you've been vaccinated when you get covid-19 (and you won't know if you are one of the unlucky few until you get it).\n\nEdit:  I think it's not possible to test this assertion experimentally because once you've had a vaccine you can't unhave it to see how you'd react to covid infection alone... but I think it's a pretty obvious conclusion given the symptoms are identical.  Vaccines save lives and prevent or reduce severe illness.

Coming from me, having been disabled by a doctor's malpractice at 31, this is a very reasonable thing to say.\n\nAnd then within an hour somebody had clicked on my name, went through my post history, and replied not about the TV show but with \"anti vaxxer\" accusations. These people have taken the fun out of life. We had a TV show we liked in common, but he just had to pry. When I clicked on his profile his avatar is a dude with a pink goatee, so I'm not entirely surprised.\n\nMy family is fighting daily amongst each other with the family medical professional pushing everyone else on how \"safe and effective\" it is and somebody else mulling over the decision every second of every day. This person keeps reminding me all the reasons they don't want to take it until I've finally said several times \"then don't take it, but shut the hell up about it already\"\n\nWhat is this all about?

This Guy A was about to go to the vaccine center to get his shot, but Guy B loudly broadcasted (they were in front of our gate) that the vaccine is \"more dangerous\" than the virus itself (hahaha okay). That Guy B watched a Facebook video of an \"expert\" claiming that Covid-19 vaccines cause more harm than prevention (duh, you can be completely vaccinated and still get the virus, but it won't be severe).\n\nIt probably took Guy A a lot of courage to finally decide on getting the shot, but some idiot was literally on his face telling him not to and so he got conflicted. My dad and I for a moment interrupted the two men (since I was going to work and I don't wanna be late; I'm never late), so we told Guy A to be on his way to the vaccine center and if I just had more time, I would've definitely argued with Guy B.\n\nNow I'm at work and I looked up the video Guy B was talking about, and it's probably this endocrinologist, Dr. Dolores Octaviano. Her claims were fact-checked and proven to be false. So please guys, don't be gullible and believe what you've heard or seen.

The former is more dangerous for public health. The COVID-19 vaccines have been one of the few bright spots during this pandemic. While anyone can get infected, the old have a thousand-fold higher mortality risk than the young.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;By vaccinating older people, the country has saved thousands of lives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is intense pressure on young adults and children to be vaccinated. Universities such as Colombia, Cornell, Harvard and Stanford require all students to get the shot as a condition of attending college normally. Young people looking for work are discriminated against if they are not vaccinated. It makes public health sense to require some vaccinations in some settings. However, in the case of COVID vaccines for young people, such mandates harm public health.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;First, all medical interventions should pass the test of providing more benefits than risks. For the COVID vaccine, this is decidedly true for older populations but it is not yet clear for younger people. While we know that COVID vaccines have common but mild adverse reactions, we will not know enough about rare but serious adverse reactions until a few years after vaccine approval.\n\n\\---\n\n&gt;Anyone who refuses vaccine without medical reason should definitely have less privileges.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With that said. Medical reason need to include long term effects on pregnancy and fetus baby development, as we don't have enough long term data. So forcing pregnant woman to Vaccinate is not an answer.\n\nYou are right to be concerned about long-term effects on pregnant women and their baby.\n\nYoung people are also at risk of unknown long-term effects.\n\nIn medicine, treatment is always based on cost-benefit analysis.\n\nTreatment is warranted only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.\n\nAnd it is highly questionable to force young healthy people to take experimental injections that are not clearly beneficial for them.\n\n[https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/558757-the-ill-advised-push-to-vaccinate-the-young](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/558757-the-ill-advised-push-to-vaccinate-the-young)\n\n&gt;**The ill-advised push to vaccinate the young**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Martin Kulldorff, PhD, is a biostatistician, epidemiologist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

I have had tendonitis in that shoulder and the shot was kinda close to that area and has intensified the pain in my shoulder. Yesterday an itchy rash has developed on the spot where I got the shot.\n\nI was told by my doctor that this was normal. Everyone I know was fine in a day or two and this has been going on 2 weeks.\n\nGenerally I have been in good health. I was diagnosed as diabetic but lost 25 lbs and cut out all carbs and sugar and my blood levels are normal now. I have not been sick in the last 7 years. I did not get flu shots during that time. The last year I got the flu shot was the last time I was sick.\n\nI am taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg and  Almodipine 10mg for my high blood pressure Synthroid 75mcg for my hypothyroidism both of which are under control with medication.\n\nAm I allergic to the vaccine? Is this a reaction to the medicines I'm taking or my diet? Should I get a different vaccine - is that even possible? I'm so afraid the 2nd shot will paralyze me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "neutral"}]}

Since I moved out of her house a few years ago, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been a lot easier to keep disagreements civil, but her response to the pandemic has been progressively making that more difficult. She refuses to wear a mask in public or practice social distancing, and because sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s (somehow) still not contracted the virus, she wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t acknowledge how dangerous and damaging it actually is. Since the vaccines started rolling out, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve been very clear about my intentions of getting vaccinated, and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been very clear about her intentions not to. Her concern is that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been no long-term study to document possible side-effects, and as a result of this concern, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s not allowing my little sisters, who are both under 18, live with her, and WANT the vaccine, to get it. This has been a major point of contention in our familyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s relationship for weeks now, and 2 days ago I finally put my foot down and told my mom that I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be visiting the family at all until she allows my little sisters to get vaccinated. I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t very nice about it, admittedly. I told her she was being irresponsible and unfair and short-sighted before I gave her the ultimatum, to which she just replied ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœthat makes me sad, but if thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s really how you feel, I will respect your decisionÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. I told her it makes me sad too. Since then, IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve just been second guessing myself on the whole thing and wondering if IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m actually in the wrong here. I know global health is obviously extremely important and ending the pandemic should be a cause thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s obviously morally right to contribute to, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m worried I might have just burned a bridge between myself and my family. Am I the buttface here? Please let me know.\n\n\nTL;DR: My mom, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s an anti-masker with a bad habit of downplaying the dangers of COVID, wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t let my under-18 little sisters get vaccinated due to lack of long-term studies, even though my little sisters have voiced their desire to get vaccinated.

We all know that the government is corrupt and that they’re just bought off the big companies. They are begging millennials to have children because we need workers.

But it seems like once the vaccine gets full FDA approval it’ll be very likely that insurance companies will push for vaccinations to lower their costs, and those who don’t get vaccinated might get higher premiums. But also, countries with free healthcare are getting the vaccine.. like Canada who is also using Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J. So the vaccine making us sicker will also cost companies more, which again I can’t see why they would do that since money is everything. \n\nThey can already track us with our phones and listen in on us if they wanted to.

Weâ€™ve traveled, been to gatherings, and mask whenever we go to highly crowded places like the airport. Not one of us have fallen sick, even though Iâ€™m at higher risk for my age group (obese) yet I havenâ€™t gotten it once. My mother has been exposed no less than 5 times at her work, she hasnâ€™t fallen sick once. We have natural immunity at this point. We take the normal precautions of using masks... the vaccine is so pointless. \n\nIs there any hope once your family starts trying to convince you to get the vaxx? Every day I worry about my brother getting a potential side effect injury, even though when him getting the vaxx was entirely unwarranted. Heâ€™s young, active, a healthy male. His wife is the same, a young, active, healthy female. They never needed a jab for a virus they have a leg up on surviving. My father has tried the same with my mom, though my dad getting the jab makes more sense (obese, smoker, and he has several medical issues). \n\nAt one time, because of my weight, I considered getting it. But the amount of vaccine injury reports and deaths Iâ€™ve seen on here, I donâ€™t want it. The lack of studies proving it worthwhile and effective, I donâ€™t want it. It being constantly pushed on me by the gov, by MSM, by my own family and by social media despite all the glaring issues, I donâ€™t want it. \n\n\nWhy is it SO hard for people to understand?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "negative"}]}

COVID or otherwise.\nThe only people who should not be getting vaccinated are people who have health issues that could be compromised by the vaccine which is an infinitesimally small percentage of the population. Everyone else needs to get it. No excuses.\n\nThe anti-vaxxers are especially problematic because they are actively trying to frame the pro-vaccine people as these belligerent, freedom hating tyrants when in reality it's the other way around. Projection and nothing more. Those people who scream about freedom when being asked to wear a mask know nothing of the word, and are simply belligerent children who don't like being told what do.\n\nI've also noticed that people who refuse the COVID vaccine don't actually have any reason as to why they won't take it, and as a result they give these long, convoluted and drawn out explanations as to why they won't get it. When in reality the reason is, \"I just don't want it.\" Which is not a legitimate reason. Either that, or they huff and puff away from the conversation, angry that you used facts, logic and their own words against them. These people don't want to have a conversation and no amounts of facts and logic are going to change their minds. They want to have their beliefs reaffirmed by likeminded people, and then they get angry and play the victim when they aren't.\n\nHere are some examples I heard personally, this is going to come across as extremely condescending so bear with me, but I think it illustrates the point quite well.\n\n* \"Well it's a personal choice.\" Nope. Insufficient answer. Get the vaccine.\n* \"There hasn't been enough research.\" Nope. Insufficient answer. There has been plenty of research over months of clinical trials and thousands of volunteers with little to no ill effects. Plus half of the country has gotten it and there have been what? 100 cases of side effects out of 160 million people? The evidence does not support your reasoning. Get the vaccine.\n* \"1 to 2 percent death rate.\" Nope. Insufficient answer. COVID might not kill you personally but it's not exactly pleasant. Even peak human beings like Jayson Tatum have gone on record as saying it really screwed them up. Even if it won't kill you personally, you could infect someone who could die from it. Or you could get a more severe case since you're not vaccinated. You've also demonstrated that you're not a gambler. Talking about the 1 to 2 percent death rate but you're betting on the 0.0025 percent chance that you're going to have detrimental effects from the vaccine. FOH. Get the vaccine.\n* \"I'm worried about my reproductive system.\" Nope. Insufficient answer. People who parrot this are likely getting it from a Facebook story that said vaccines caused birth defects in the 50's and 60's. Now I know the occurrences they are referring to and they were not caused by vaccines but by Thalidomide pills instead. You were tricked. Get the vaccine.\n* \"What am I not entitled to my opinion?\" You're entitled to your opinion which is wrong but so is everyone else. You're not the only one with an opinion and people who say this expose themselves as self centered since they seem to think that their opinion matters more than that of others, or that it's a special opinion because it's contrarian. Wrong. Not unique, just wrong. Get the vaccine.\n\nThese people also try so hard to make themselves out like some kind of martyr. Like they're fighting a good fight. But they're not heroes, they're not martyrs, they're not being \"cancelled\" they're not victims and they're certainly not fighting a good fight. They're on the wrong side of history and will be remembered as such. There are so many more visceral and insulting things I want to say but I'm worried about violating rule 2.\n\nThe news media is also not doing a good job of covering the issue. Giving both sides equal time when they absolutely shouldn't. They should be pro-vaxx and pro-vaxx alone. While shitting on anti-vaxxers and their rhetoric with extreme vitriol.

Many people are unhealthy, have underlying conditions or are genetically predisposed to fair poorly with COVID.  We just don't know.  So blanket policy is all we have.

If the vaccines prevent even just 5% of people from going to the hospital do some quick math on how many people that is in a country like the USA or even Canada.\n5. It's not about a shortage of ICU beds its about a shortage of nurses to tend to them.  You can't just double your trained nurses in 18 months.  Schooling/training takes time.\n6. This pandemic is a real threat to all of us in one way or another.  If we could just start their we would be much better off.\n7.

Those who choose not to take the vaccine ignore this concern and therefore act immorally. But the U.S. allows people to use this \"belief\" to exempt themselves and people, including children are harmed.\n\nChildren with  COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are about 21% of all cases. About 88,500 new pediatric COVID-19 cases were reported according to the [latest weekly report](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/) from the AAP and ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Hospital Association.

In Washington state, thousands of state workers are seeking similar exemptions.

Even though few organized religions have taken theological stands against vaccination, employees still can usually claim a religious exemption based on their beliefs that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t have to follow an organized religion.\n\nLaws that require vaccination are the epitome of a neutral law of general applicability: a requirement that applies to everyone and that was not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion. Even if this were not so, the government can infringe on religious freedom if its action is necessary to achieve a compelling interest.\n\nStopping the spread of a deadly communicable disease is obviously a compelling interest and vaccinations are the best way to reach that goal.

Beyond the frightening implications such a decision could have on civil liberties, i.e., enforced medical discrimination, there are a number of valid reasons why some \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ians remain hesitant to take the COVID vaccine.\n\nBoth the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine are based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has never been approved for human use. Previous attempts at developing therapeutic drugs using this technology resulted in toxicity from repeat doses, which is particularly troubling given the active discussions on booster shots due to waning efficacy:\n\n&gt;“Moderna had to pivot. If repeated doses of mRNA were too toxic to test in human beings, the company would have to rely on something that takes only one or two injections to show an effect.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“But when repeated doses of mRNA are needed to resupply a protein over a lifetime, side effects—potentially due to the buildup of lipid nanoparticles in the body or an inflammatory response to foreign RNA—loom larger.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/messenger-rna-gave-us-covid-19-vaccine-will-it-treat-diseases-too](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/messenger-rna-gave-us-covid-19-vaccine-will-it-treat-diseases-too)\n\nUnlike most vaccines, which typically take 10-15 years to develop and test, the current set of COVID-19 vaccines have only undergone a few months of clinical trials and have no long term safety profile. Consequently, it is unknown whether antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or other autoimmune issues, which occurred in previous trials of coronavirus vaccines (e.g. SARS and MERS), could arise at a later time or with different, mutated strains of the virus.\n\nThe vaccine has already been linked with heart inflammation (myocarditis) in young adolescents/adults, with an incidence rate of up to 1 in 3000 according to one report submitted to the Israeli Ministry of Heath. This age group, in particular, has a significantly lower risk of developing severe reactions from the virus itself, with an infection fatality rate estimated to be less than 0.01%.\n\nIn addition, the efficacy of the vaccine and its ability to reduce transmission remains under question. In many countries with high percentages of their population fully vaccinated, including Iceland, Israel, and Malta, cases are markedly rising and the majority of hospitalized patients are now fully vaccinated. Gibraltar, in particular, has the highest vaccination rate in the world (greater than 99%) but is still currently undergoing its second highest wave in COVID-19 cases. New data from the Israeli Ministry of Health also suggests significantly lower efficacy over time:\n\n&gt;“The Israeli statistics also appeared to paint a picture of protection that gets weaker as months pass after vaccination, due to fading immunity. People vaccinated in January were said to have just 16% protection against infection now, while in those vaccinated in April, effectiveness was at 75%.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-uk-data-offer-mixed-signals-on-vaccines-potency-against-delta-strain/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-uk-data-offer-mixed-signals-on-vaccines-potency-against-delta-strain/)\n\nIn this case, the burden of proof lies on the vaccine makers to prove the safety and efficacy of their vaccines. While many \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ians have taken the vaccine, others prefer to take a more cautious approach with a novel, experimental medication and should not be discriminated against based on this personal health decision. This is an absolutely fundamental, red line issue for many \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ians like myself – the freedom to decide what medical procedures I undergo without fear of discrimination or segregation. \n\nSincerely,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "negative"}]}

And SUPER happy no one in their group ever reported infection scares, despite all their busy schedules and working around large groups (since they usually have a dance team on stage with them).\n\nThey could still get infected by covid, but itâ€™s so nice to know they wonâ€™t die from it, or their recovery time will be much quicker and risk of damage to their lungs/development of respiratory symptoms will also be greatly reduced. \n\nGood job BNM staff and BNM managers for helping keep people masked up as much as possible during the past year of quarantine restrictions. ðŸ‘ They also got lucky but props to them for also protecting their staff, and I always see the managers masked up at least. I am still a little amazed AB6IX never had a covid scare because they do some risky things (like taking masks off in the music show waiting rooms, being maskless behind stage before performing). \n\nAnyway, when it comes to covid, the best good news is no news at all :) So good job AB6IX &amp; BNM for staying covid-free all the way up to vaccination! ðŸ…"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "positive"}]}

If life is going to be like this forever and this 'new normal' nonsense persists, I don't know what I'm living in this world for anymore. Everyone tells me that I should just make the best of the situation, and aim for partial normality/do as many activities as the current situation permits. Am I wrong to say that that is not enough for me? I don't want partial normality, or \"some semblance\" of freedom. I want my freedom back.

Businesses have folded, entire industries (especially travel) have been halted for more than a year, and so many people are unemployed. People kept saying last year that this would be over in Fall 2021, but it certainly does not seem to be over now. Now WHO is saying end of 2022.

I had every symptom as it ran its course for approximately 21 days. Once my fever broke, around day 10 or 11, I began to improve drastically each day.  As of today, I still do not have taste or smell. Other than that, I feel fine. I have lost approximately 40 pounds since I tested positive (lack of taste and smell makes me hardly eat and the random depressing/psychological effects etc). When I caught Covid, I was not vaccinated. I wore a mask diligently and followed all guidelines.  I believe I caught it at work, as I am a waitress on the Vegas strip and see hundreds of people a day. \n\nA week ago, July 19th, I got my first shot of Pfzier . I was pretty scared since I had had Covid on how my body would react to the shot. I felt nothing when I got the shot, it was super quick and painless. I got it at 1 PM. By 2:30 PM, my arm began to feel sore, nothing terrible. By 6 PM, I felt like I needed a nap and arm soreness increased. I fought the urge to nap at that time and I took some ibuprofen for my arm. At approximately 8:45 PM, I went to sleep. When I woke up on Wednesday morning, I felt fine but my arm was pretty damn sore. Took more ibuprofen and went about my day. Wednesday evening, again around 6 PM, I was exhausted.  By 9 PM, I was in bed. While in bed, I began to get a headache, some body chills/fever going back and forth. If I'm being honest, for a second I thought \"Oh no! This is how I felt when I first got Covid!\" But I took more ibuprofen and tried to think how happy how I was to finally be vaccinated. I fell asleep and upon waking up Thursday AM, I was 100% (as far as vaccine side effects). My second dose is scheduled August 10, so I will update you guys then! \n\nI just wanted to share my experience, as I know many people who had Covid may be weary about getting the shot because they've heard the side effects can be much worse. In my experience, there were side effects. But, I personally, would have rather had those side effects than to ever get covid again. I hope someone out there finds this useful and any questions, please ask.

However, we talk about his job quite a lot and I recently saw a couple of the lists that airlines have in case they need a pilot on short notice. My dad just recently became a captain so his seniority is quite low, meaning he doesnt often get the chance to take these trips. Recently that has changed and im sure most of you already know where this is going. He had a few days off but started getting alerts non stop about these trips being offered to him ever since airlines have started forcing vaccines on their employees and pilots. At first when I saw this I just thought it was coincidence, but research and some thinking made me realize it isnt coincidence at all.\nPilots are walking out at a higher rate than ever. On multiple lists I saw there were a few people ahead of him declining trips (ones with the vaxx probably) and then under him are a majority of pilots titled as \"not qualified\" (pilots refusing the vaxx), something I have never seen before. The airlines deny it and cover it up as many different reasons, but the real reason to me is clear as its just happening now that the jab is being mandated. The media wont share this either obviously.\nThe rates at which people are denying the jab is much more than any media will say or most people think. In an important, more liberal job like pilots and airline employees, the rate is much lower than most career fields but from what ive seen, if I had to put a number on it, I would say upwards of 65% are refusing the jab.\nI wanted to share this to anyone hesitant about getting it if their job depends on it.

I was born here and have lived here most of my life. My son was also born here. I work as a financial analyst for a utility company.\n\nBoth Tyson and Walmart (both huge in Arkansas, especially Walmart) have mandated vaccination for their employees, as have many hospitals, which I am vehemently against. I don't believe that is an employer's business, and believe that is coercion and removes medical informed consent from an individual. There has been push back, and I found that a State senator filed a bill on 8-5 that would make it illegal for employers to ask vaccination status or discriminate based on vaccination status.\n\nThe AR Senate was supposed to take it up a few days ago, and did not. It seemed like it was dead for at least 2 months. However, yesterday, a joint House and Senate hearing of the judiciary committee heard testimony from employer reps, employees, doctors, legal experts, and those who have been harmed by vaccines in the past. \n\nIt was voted to move forward in committee and they are trying to get reps to sign on to bringing the legislature back in session to debate it. I'm keeping a close eye on this, and I felt there were many reps that were on board. You can tell that they have been getting lots of calls. One rep told the Tyson rep, \"a lot of your employees have been calling me, worried they are going to lose their jobs.\"\n\nI personally feel that the case was better made for passing the law to ban employer mandates than the employers made the case for why they are doing it. \n\nA doctor who testified stated that every drug, vaccine or procedure offered needs to allow for informed consent, and that the patient needs to hear the pros and cons before partaking in that treatment, and that isn't happening here. He was not opposed to the covid vaccine, but didn't see why healthy teens would need it.\n\nIt gives me hope though that this madness will be stopped in my state at least. Hopefully. Our governor is terrible, has been pushing vaccines like crazy, and even regrets lifting his own mask mandate (the legislature basically forced him to), so I can see him vetoing it if it passes, but then again, if it has enough support from the people, he'll sign it, or they'll override his veto. They did that recently with a trans kids law that got lots of attention, including on Tucker Carlson's show.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long rant, but I think these employer's mandates are terrible for employees, especially low skilled and poorer individuals and amount to coercion. I can post a link to the entire committee meeting if anyone wants to watch it. It was really fascinating, and gave me hope for some sanity in my state."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "negative"}]}

His arm hurt a bit but aside from that he was fine. But at night he got pretty high fever, chills and basically his whole body hurt. Obviously he got pretty sick because of so much stress and hence he had to take 40mg hydrocortisone at once. (This is the recommended amount for high fever following his doctor) We decided against using the emergency syringe he got from his doctor because he was still responsive and his blood pressure was ok, but that syringe was laying next to us and I was definitely ready to use it the second he would not have answered to me anymore. \nAfter he took the hydrocortisone and some ibuprofen to help with the pain and the fever he finally felt better. He was able to sleep and feels way better today. \n\nI think our advise would be to definitely make sure to double dose the day of the vaccination and have a lot cortisone available for the night.

I also suffered fatigue and a headache for a couple of days after the first shot but was generally well.

I don't want to be infected by some fucktard whining about wearing a mask and all that (I've wore a mask since the beginning and it puts me into a rage when all I hear is \"the unvaccinated are causing the spread\"). If I'm gonna get sick, I want it to be due to my own stupidity. And having taken my gramma to the clinic for a simple follow up, there was like no parking. Hospitals are turning patients away because they're just at max capacity. At this point, I've been doing my considerations and I just feel like my risk of waiting to see long term side effects is just not worth it.\n\nSo anyways I'm scheduled to get the Pfizer today, if I get sick, I just want a better fighting chance, hopefully. I chose it because it's the same one my gf has taken and a few other friends. And I just want to get it while I still have a choice as to which one I take. The only complaints they reported was soreness at the injection site, which seems to be pretty common all around from what I've heard. But I don't know any other diabetics who've taken the vaccine, or anything they felt that I should be aware of. I've not had any issues with other vaccines I've taken, but like I said, this one is completely new and hasn't been around for decades to know.\n\nSo, did you take it? Which one? Anything I should be aware of such as sugar levels temporarily thrown around or whatever? Thanks for any input ÃƒÂ°Ã‚ÂŸÃ‚Â˜Ã‚Â\n\nEDIT:: Got my first dose yesterday. Went well, didn't feel a thing.

Then they can slowly but surely throw all the people who refuse the vaccine in jail with the rest of the criminals. \n\nNormally, when I get to this point, I remind myself that the vast majority of people are good, and would see the horror in this and protest side by side with the unvaccinated. But the MSM propaganda is actually overwhelming, to the point that I believe people will see this genocide happening, and say ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœwell they chose not to get vaccinated.

He has been placed in a hospice care facility through the VA, a facility that only allows visitors that have been fully vaccinated. He has been given an estimated 6 months, which honestly, might be a stretch due to the severity and variety of health problems he has been battling with the last couple of years. Because of this, I am leaning towards abandoning most of my principles, along with all logic and reason, and getting the jab.\n\nI see the writing on the wall, and while part of me wants to fight the overt implementation of global medical tyranny, the other part of me is tired of standing on principle in a world where it is scarce and wishes to take part in it no more. Hopefully, I will be fortunate enough to grow old with my fiance on a farm, traveling a world that denounces the neo-fascist attempts to enslave all of humanity to a life of subjugation and serfdom, but I'm okay if that isn't the case, as on some level I have felt like I've been on borrowed time since my first deployment to Iraq in 2006.\n\nRegardless of whether I get the \"vaccine\" or not, I will continue to speak out against the curtailing of our civil liberties. As a request, I implore you all to hold out as long as you can; to stand on principle where my legs have become weak. Someone must be the control group in this dark experiment where multinational pharmaceutical corporations are making billions off the suffering of all humanity by way of coercion and threat of force. This is even more important now that we have learned these companies have intentionally destroyed the clinical trial control groups.\n\nMy second and last request from you all this day is that you are kind, not only to each other, but especially to those with differing views. At the end of the day, all but a few of us are just trying to do what we think is right. Seek dialogue, not debate, and choose love instead of hate. Try not to get sucked into the team mindset that makes it easier for elites to divide us and further consolidate power and wealth amongst themselves. I know it can be hard sometimes when it seems so many are against you, but darkness can only be defeated by light.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your kind words and input. I was able to see my grandfather today. I took some things to him from the assisted care facility that he was previously at to his new residence. They didn't ask if I was vaccinated, only went down a checklist of questions regarding symptoms and took my temperature. Hopefully, this is how it remains and I am able to continue to see him without having to get the experimental \"vaccine.\" I hate to think this, but I did have the thought that my mom maybe lied to me when she said they are only allowing vaccinated visitors in an attempt to try and pressure me into getting the shot. Either way, for now, all is well Again, thank you for your heartfelt responses. Be well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "negative"}]}

The lucky ones among us are able to watch from afar because once you enter the pandemic officially, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s no going back. Only money, connections and sheer dumb luck will help some of you emerge alive at the end. Sharing my experience (it continues) in the hopes that everyone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s suffering knows there are others out there suffering with them, and as a deadly warning for everyone lucky enough to be safe still. What we read is just the tip of the hellish iceberg.\n\nI (female,30) tested positive earlier in April. I ran a high fever and recovered in under a week. There were moments where I was scared but confident in my health and body that I would recover. And I did. And now I know IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™m among the ones who were just incredibly bloody lucky to be alive. \n\nA week later my 91-year-old grandmother tested positive. She was asymptomatic. By the second day her fever rose. A good family doctor reassured us that her case was mild and she would pull through. We gave her fever medication and did all we could to keep her comfortable. By Day 4 her fever was still there and we were concerned. The doc ordered blood tests and a CT scan. Everything was clear. Her CT score was 5, and her oxygen levels close to 94. She was stable and healthy. Another doctor said sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ll be fine too. Day 6 of her fever we rushed her to the emergency room of a major hospital. Her oxygen levels were at 95 and she was stable, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a calculated risk to keep her at home but she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t require hospitalisation said the doctors. They said space the fever medication and sponge her down. Day 7 we let the fever rise hoping it would break. By the 10th hour after she had taken her medication the fever hit 103 degrees. We immediately gave her meftal and she was better soon. The fever was gone. And then, hours later her oxygen started dropping.\n\nWe rushed to the ER the next morning. AGAIN, doctors said sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s stable with oxygen at 95 but said check with the OPD doctor. Two hours later OPD doc says sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s borderline, hospitalise her. But where. There were no beds. We headed home. By then we had started calling places for a bed. Her oxygen declined to 85 at home. A covid care hotel agreed to take her in and we headed there no matter the exorbitant cost. The doctor there put her on oxygen but said sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s too critical, take her elsewhere. They called an ambulance and we headed to the closest major hospital. A doctor at the ER there came out, glanced at my grandmother lying in the ambulance and said take her wherever you want thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s nothing here. We put her in the car and headed for home.\n\nAll this while I was dialling places frantically. A small medical facility got back to me. They had an oxygen bed but the doctor was clear that if she turned critical there would be nothing they could do about it. We rushed there and she was finally admitted, nearly 12 hours after we headed out in the morning. \n\nVery very hard lessons learned:\nA) 1. The situation is completely helpless and a hundred times worse than everything youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve read. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s NOTHING out there. NOTHING. All there is the goodwill of some people who may call you back or answer your calls. \n\n2. MONEY. This will DRAIN your finances. EVERY. THING. COSTS. MONEY. You will lose money at EVERY STEP. And thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s no guarantee, NO guarantee that even all the money you spend will help maybe even 1 per cent. Beds, medicines, tests, ambulances and hospitals will cause you to bleed money:\n\n3. HOSPITALISE EARLY. I CANNOT stress this enough. PLEASE HOSPITALISE ALL EARLY. Doctors donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to admit anyone who is just about okay. PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO THIS, HOSPITALISE EARLY. \nUSE THE TIME THAT YOUR PATIENT IS STABLE AND STEADY TO FIND A BED. PLEASE PLEASE donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t make any assumptions, especially if the patient is even above 40. Please donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t depend on ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœhome remediesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœmanagingÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â it at home. PLEASE PLEASE donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t take such chances unless you are a qualified doctor. \n\n 4. PLEASE GET VACCINATED. PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS and all high risk people. Vaccination is going to be difficult in the coming days but please do it and stay safe, protect vulnerable people till you can get vaccinated.\n\nB) 1. THE BASICS \nLook for non oxygen beds for mild cases and get reports such as blood tests, DDimer, CRP, ferritin, LDH.\n\n2. CT scan is very important and please make it a point to get this by the 5th, earlier if your patient is not doing well. Hospitals, and any leads you follow will ask for basic information.\n\n3. START EARLY. Leave for hospitals early in the day, 7am or so you get a head start and have the whole day to work on leads for a bed, tests etc. \n\n4. Maintain a database of all key numbers such as hospitals, ambulances, testing centres etc\n\n5. Get tested at home if possible. Testing centres are a crowded mess\n\n6. Spread the word aggressively that you need help. Ask. For. Help. We have only each other right now. \n\n7. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t move a patient until a bed can be confirmed. Things are erratic as hell and change by the minute\n\n8. Proactively monitor oxygen levels and the temperature if your patient is at home or a basic facility. Press the panic button early in case of ANY DROP. \n\n9. Compulsorily have a thermometer and an oximeter and strips of dolo and meftal 500 at home. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s been a traumatic experience so far. I wish we had gotten my grandmother vaccinated early but we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want to take her to crowded centre and expose her to the virus and end up in hospital. And IT STILL HAPPENED.  I wish we had gotten her admitted at the earliest. And I wish I had never gotten infected. But I did. And so many of us are even with everything weÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re doing. My grandmotherÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s lungs are infected, we know where this is headed but itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s heartbreaking to be here. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™re waiting for my motherÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s test and she is like to be positive too. The only consolation is that she was vaccinated a week before I tested positive.\n\nMENTAL HEALTH\nitÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s difficult to even describe how hellish the last few days have been. And the worst is yet to come. I count myself lucky to have money, a home and food and a job. People are dying suffering in unimaginable ways, people with much less than I have. Experiencing this trauma and watching so many others suffer has been devastating. For me, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s a 90 year old in hospital, for countless others itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s parents, breadwinners, the only hope living relativeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦.. the list goes on. Be kind to each other, thank the ones who are good to you, everyone is suffering in different ways, entire families have been devastated. Be kind, as much as you can. \n\nThe worst is yet to come for me and my family. We will have difficult decisions to make in the days to come. But for now, as I try to make my exhausted mind rest, I hope and dream of a time when we will experience some happiness again. Take care everyone and stay safe."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "positive"}]}

The only way they are getting away with this massive brainwashing scheme is with social media (with the help of algorithms and obedient citizens) and MSM. \n\nThe reality is, less than 20% of the population is vaccinated. \n\nThe reality is, most people donâ€™t even have the privilege of accessing a vaccine yet. \n\nThe reality is, many people who do have the privilege are exercising their choice not to get it. \n\nEvery time I go outside Iâ€™m shocked. When I go to walk my dog, I would guess I see 1/8 people wearing a mask outside. Itâ€™s actually rare to see it, despite the mask ordinances. \n\nLast week I went to Oakland and I visited Lake Merrit which since 2020 has become basically an open air market for all sorts of things. **70% of people were not wearing a mask, not wearing one correctly, or halfway dangling them off their faces**. I was astonished. I even seen an anti mask parade, people passing out flyers warning people about the â€œvaccineâ€ (with all factual info), people holding up signs saying â€œshow me your smileâ€ and â€œthanks for not wearing a maskâ€. I seen a woman passing out slips of paper questioning the logic of masks.  The people who were wearing masks just politely filtered through the crowd, shopping, sightseeing and hanging out with their friends. I had only positive interactions with them. This is in California of all places. \n\nI seen something similar in Californiaâ€™s capitol, Sacramento, (people freely out and about, mingling, not really wearing masks and enjoying life). \n\nI could not believe my eyes. Iâ€™ve been staying inside a lot this past year, because frankly the world seems to have gone crazy and I donâ€™t want any parts. The fact that people are being essentially black listed on my Facebook homepage and twitter feed for saying they donâ€™t want the vaccine, the fact that â€œanti vaxxersâ€ are being labeled and a narrative is being pushed by MSM, the fact that there is this weird ostracizing thing happening, is just another tool to brainwash people. Most people are not really going for this, even in California. They might just not be fighting back that hard yet. \n\nThe thing is, the people I know who have gotten vaccinated, are the same people that I seen flouting the restrictions all last year. They werenâ€™t all hiding out in their homes and having no contact with their friends. People were still hooking up and casually dating. I seen people going to parties. I also see them posting â€œCovid is realâ€ and virtue signaling on social media even though I see them stretching the rules in life or in their photos (not social distancing, wearing their masks improperly, leaving their house, being photographed with people who arenâ€™t wearing a mask, celebrating thanksgiving, getting their nails done). These are the same people I see 6 months later posting and encouraging people to get the shot, chastising â€œconspiracy theoristsâ€ and promoting public health community outreach efforts. \n\nI donâ€™t think these people are afraid of Covid at all. They just want to go back to normal and are willing to do whatever the government says for it. They want to conform and fit in with the crowd, as theyâ€™ve always done, and avoid being the outcasts of society. They donâ€™t want to talk about their hesitancy with the vaccines or the questions they have with the narrative because theyâ€™re afraid of getting singled out by their peers and shunned/doxxed. Some join in openly disparaging the people that question the narrative, even a little bit, making the people who are even more afraid to speak up. \n\nPeople seem to be more afraid of each other than they are the government or covid. \n\nI feel like the type of people who donâ€™t believe in forcing people to wear masks or forcing them to take an experimental drug are also the type of people that donâ€™t feel like forcing their opinions or choices down the throat of others. They live and let live. They are also probably not on social media all day. The ones who are indoors and love these draconian practices and want more, are the ones driving the social media narrative thatâ€™s dominating the voices of the vast majority of people. Couple that with shadowbanning and censorship and you have a recipe for the ultimate social media marketing scheme. \n\nHow many people even have twitter or ig accounts and are active on them? Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a lot, but how many compared to the population in the US? How many of those accounts are real people? When has the dominating cultural/social attitude on these social media sites ever been reflective of reality? \n\nMy point is that theyâ€™re not and I see this every time I go outside. If you were really that scared of Covid, if nine members of your family dropped dead of it, I canâ€™t imagine you being willing to take the risk of contracting it by going outside to do non essential activities. I would think someone like that would stay inside and talk shit about everyone else thatâ€™s out. The people out enjoying life are too busy to tweet about and donâ€™t want the conflict that comes with it if someone confronts them for it. \n\nStay hopeful friends.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My (32F) wife (31F) says I am dismissing her trauma related to death by getting a covid vaccine\nSo you can see my post history and how my wife wants us to wait to get COVID vaccines. Since the last post, we agreed to open discussion again when a local drive thru site opened at the end of the month. Well the end of the month is here and it's open. I made an appointment for next week.\n\nThis set off another argument. She is still terrified that the vaccine will kill me, a young, relatively healthy person in their 30s. She has this huge trauma related to her brother's death when she was a teenager. At the time, she was in an abusive situation at her mother's house, and her older brother offered to let her move in with him and take care of her. He died in a tragic accident shortly before she was due to move in.\n\nSo now she's experiencing fear due to this trauma. At the moment she is financially dependent on me because she has been unable to get a job since moving to be with me. So she feels a lack of control and a similar situation to being stuck at her mother's house.\n\nSo once again, I said that I am confident that the vaccine will not kill me. She says this is denying her trauma. I said no, I am not denying that you went through a trauma, but this is my health, my body, my choice. And she says that this is her biggest trauma, her biggest fear, and she needs more time to go through therapy and deal with it so she can feel okay about me getting the vaccine. It's also not just my body my choice because if I die it affects her. If I were to get the vaccine, she would feel nonstop anxious for weeks waiting to see if it killed me. She said she wants me to be able to get it, but just not yet. Maybe not until full FDA licensing, which could be months away. \n\nShe did bring up the valid point that if I were to die, she wouldn't know what to do financially. I assured her that I have enough life insurance and in my retirement accounts to take care of her for many years. I am working on putting together information about all my accounts for her and finally getting my will in order so that my house will pass to her without any legal issues. \n\nHowever, I'm tired of waiting to get the vaccine. I reassured her that after getting the vaccine, I am not going to rush to see people or anything. But I too have anxiety which manifests as catastrophic thoughts, and there's a constant worry in the back of my mind that something will happen out of my control (I fall down the stairs, car accident, whatever) and I won't be protected. For my own anxiety, I want to get the vaccine as soon as I can. I feel like I've done my waiting, I've already compromised, and I don't want to compromise anymore. She says I have to compromise if I want to be in a relationship.\n\nNow it seems straight up mean to just be like \"I'm going to get my vaccine now, see you later.\" I genuinely do not want to put her through weeks of torment. But I want this vaccine! I feel it's the best decision for my health. My therapist says it was one of my goals to stand up for myself more and suggested this as an opportunity. I agreed and I feel 100% confident that getting the vaccine is a good decision for me personally.\n\nI don't want to dismiss her trauma, but saying I should wait to get the vaccine is completely irrational. Anxiety isn't rational. I want to be a good partner and not cause her anxiety, but this just seems ridiculous to me. I am willing to wait perhaps two more weeks but I really don't want to.

If they do occur, it's highly unlikely that a person will need to be hospitalized, according a study posted Friday to the preprint server MedRxiv. (Studies posted to preprint severs have not been peer-reviewed.)\n\nWhen Rice has seen breakthrough cases needing hospitalization, it was only in patients with compromised immune systems, who therefore likely did not respond as well to the vaccines.\n\n\"One of the ones we took care of had cancer, and another was on immunosuppressants for a rheumatologic disease,\" Rice said.\n\nLyn-Kew, too, had one or two extremely ill patients who'd been fully vaccinated.\n\n\"It turns out they were all immunosuppressed,\" he said.\n\nSome, he said, had cancer at the time of their shots and did not respond well to the vaccines.\n\nThough the CDC recommends people get vaccinated regardless of whether they were previously infected, Lyn-Kew said some of his hospitalized patients had decided to forgo vaccination because of previous illness ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” even if they'd never been tested to confirm they had Covid-19.\n\n\"They thought they were sick from Covid, but they weren't. And they have the mindset of, 'Oh, I don't need to get vaccinated because of that,'\" Lyn-Kew said. \"They're gravely mistaken.\"\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/virtually-all-hospitalized-covid-patients-have-one-thing-common-they-n1270482"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "positive"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I spent like an hour writing this reply to someone in another thread and I'd like your thoughts on it as well. I try not to seek external validation but sometimes I feel like I'm crazy for suggesting that long term studies are important.\nI am more than happy to share my views. Thank you for being willing to listen. A few things I want to get out of the way first, I’m 23 years old. I am not an expert in anything. I don’t claim to be and don’t try to be. If anything I’d say that I know enough to be sure that I don’t know anything. I should also mention that I have always had a general distrust to the government/media/authority telling me what to do without question. \n\nThat being said I do have some thoughts on everything. \n\nWhy long term studies? \n\nVaccines (and pharmaceuticals in general) typically go through a lengthy approval process. From initial research to three phases of trials with various standards and expectations. The majority of medications do not make it past Phase I of their respective studies. This source says 7.9% have a likelihood of approval (1). I have had difficulty finding a reference for how long the average vaccine takes, but out of all pharmaceuticals the average is 10.5 years (1). \n\nNow the majority of that time the leaders of these programs are fighting for funding, interest, good trial participation, and other hurdles. The covid-19 vaccine clearly did not have those hurdles. This is a disease that needs to be contained so funding is abundant, volunteers are everywhere, and the need is very evident. Money can solve a lot of problems, but it cannot make time move faster. mRNA vaccines are new, plain and simple. There has never been one like it to be mass produced and distributed like the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. \n\nYes, there has been previous research on mRNA vaccines and their potential to protect against different viruses and diseases. So why is it that the covid-19 vaccines are the first mRNA vaccines to be produced? From my understanding, we do not have past trials to confirm the long term safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Based on our understanding of mRNA and the other components of the vaccine scientist believe that it is safe. That is a good reason to begin trials and carefully track the results and potential effects. I do not believe that is a reason to mass produce, speed through FDA approval, and even mandate the vaccine for participation in society. \n\nThe FDA requires at least 2-months of safety data to approve Emergency Use Authorization for a vaccine (2). Pfizer and Moderna collected this data in their combined Phase I/II trials. The main concern here is that these vaccines has not been used before. We know what to expect with other types of vaccines such as subunit, live, and inactivated vaccines (3). I view this 2 months of safety data to be more applicable to more traditional vaccines because there is clear evidence that if there are severe adverse effects they will show themselves in the first 2 months. We do not know this to be true of mRNA vaccines. There is no history, there is no precedent to turn to. The mRNA vaccines are *probably* fine, but with the abundance of anecdotal reports of adverse reactions, an overflowing number of submission to VAERS, and the immense pressure that everyone is under to just get something passed through, I have a difficult time believe that everyone truly did their due diligence. On top of that, there is so much money involved in all of this. Money corrupts people. I believe the scientists and researchers are doing their best for society. I do not believe that the CEOs of Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, and the top government officials overlooking all of this are impartial. \n\n(I will fully admit that the end of my argument there moves away from the science and more towards politics, but I still think that it is a factor into why the vaccines have been approved so quickly.)\n\nWe also do not know much about the long lasting efficacy of the vaccine. Do two doses give life time immunity for the majority? We don’t know, shots haven’t been in arms long enough. But the number of breakthrough cases are rising so perhaps not. Side note, the CDC is no longer tracking all breakthrough cases. Only those that end in hospitalization and death. (4) I think that to know the true efficacy of these vaccines we need concrete numbers of the breakthrough cases and how severe they are compared to regular infections. And did you know that in the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials, they only counted cases as positive if they received a positive molecular test AND had at least one symptom? (5, pg14 and 6, pg15) So even if the vaccine reduces symptoms, how is it effective at preventing the spread if it does not stop a person from being infected? To me this suggests that we need to spend more time studying these vaccines.\n\nI’m also concerned about how the vaccines effect the variants and future mutations. I might be totally off base here, but all I can think of is could it be similar to bacterial resistance. Could the amount of transmission between vaccinate people, regardless of how small, give rise to stronger and more resistant mutations? \n\nI will say though, that I agree the vaccine is the right choice for some people. The CFR for the elderly is extremely high and the vaccine clearly provides some sort of protection. I’m not against the vaccine altogether, I’m concerned that no one is considering the potential long term effects in younger people. At this point it should be available to those who want it but there is absolutely no reason for it to be mandated. \n\nImmediate Solutions:\n\nThis is a tough one. I spent a lot of today thinking about it because I do want to give a well thought out answer. \n\nI believe that personal responsibility is a big part of this. If you feel unsafe, take the precautions you deem necessary to stay safe. Isolate, social distance, masks, hand washing, all the things. You are not responsible for someone else’s actions. The government is not responsible for someone else’s actions. Each choice we make has associated risks, the same is true with covid. There are ways to gauge if you are likely to be exposed if you participate in an activity. Let people make their own choice on that.\n\nI know a lot of people who don’t actually mind the masks or the social distancing but they are just unsure of the vaccine. Over time it’s built into resentment for only hearing about the pandemic and the vaccine. I think that if more information was available about what to do about covid that did not mention the vaccine, people would be more willing to listen. (I’m thinking like “how to treat covid at home” “what to do when a loved on has covid” “vitamins and minerals to help you stay healthy” “wash your hands”) I also think that the stigma and shame that is brought down on people who test positive adds to an overall negative view of the people who heavily promote the vaccines, which then influences how people think of the vaccine. \n\nTreatments. I think that there needs to be an equal focus on treatments for covid. People don’t want the vaccine yet? That’s okay, here’s how to treat if you catch it and here’s how to know when you need medical attention. I know that the doctors and nurses are exhausted, that’s why we need to spend more time on effective treatments that reduce a person’s chance in the hospital. \n\nAgain, not anti-vax here, just very cautious and very distrusting of the government and big pharma in general. I’ll probably get vaccinated in the future, but I still want to wait it out. And I’m curious to learn more about Novavax. \n\n(1) [https://www.bio.org/blogs/how-long-does-it-take-get-drug-approved](https://www.bio.org/blogs/how-long-does-it-take-get-drug-approved)\n\n(2) [https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained)\n\n(3) [https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/different-types-vaccines](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/different-types-vaccines)\n\n(4) [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html)\n\n(5) [https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download)\n\n(6) [https://www.fda.gov/media/144673/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144673/download)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "neutral"}]}

There are plenty. \n\nYou may post links (as long you donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t get carried away) to whatever ridiculous information you want, but if automod deletes it (probably due to it coming from a disreputable web site) I will not correct it. \n\nFacts:\n\nBecause a person can be infected with the virus for some time without showing symptoms, it is critical that we all act as if we are infected at all times. This means wearing a mask, no drinking after others, washing your hands, and keeping as much distance as possible: even if you are vaccinated. \n\nMasks of any kind slow the spread of all airborne infection, including COVID. Higher quality masks have a better outcome but any mask is better than none. **Masks lessen the rate at which an infected wearer spreads the infection.** To a lesser degree, masks protect the wearer from infection. \n\nHand washing and social distancing will lessen the chances of getting infected or of infecting others. \n\nVaccination lowers the chance of infection, decreases the impact of infection if it does occur, and improves the overall outcomes of society as a whole. \n\nAs with any vaccination, those taking the vaccine take on a risk for a benefit to society in an act of bravery. \n\nIt is possible that the vaccines will have side effects, some short term which are generally known and there may be long term effects we have not seen yet. The odds of getting harmed by COVID are far greater than of being harmed by a vaccination against COVID. The math is dramatically in favor of getting vaccinated.\n\n**This information will almost certainly change.** The best information we have changes as our knowledge improves. This is how Science works. It should not be surprising. \n\n If you disagree with this information: keep it to yourself or post it on another sub.

I do still have antibodies even though my surgeries were in 2004 and 2008. I also have Celiacs and Fibromyalgia. The medical community here has also thrown a possibility of yet more autoimmune disorders but nothing diagnosed yet. I do have allergies to most antibiotics but the kicker for me was that I had a reaction to the Anthrax vaccine that is given subcutaneous above the tricep. This vaccine didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t react the first 3 times out of a 6 shot series. Shot 4 was the one where the base here called it ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœlocalÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â reaction without ever seeing the site. The University of Kansas called it full arm involvement and then some which actually got it reported to the CDC. The local base wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t going to report anything. The reaction started at the tricep and had a half dollar sized involvment approximately 12 hours after injection then spread to engulf the entire arm from just below the wrist on my hand and all the way up my shoulder to include part of my collar bone area, breast, and shoulder blade - obviously not a local reaction. \n\nFor the Covid vaccine, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ve had any type of reaction to any injection, they will have you wait 30 minutes rather than 15 minutes for everyone else.

No reaction at all for me but my doctors, both civilian and VA including 2 endos, 2 primary care, and my allergist, all agreed the best course of action was for me to load up on antihistamines (which I normally take daily at this higher dose) rather than discontinuing and following CDC posts regarding antihistamines and potentially masking anaphylaxis. \n\nFor side effects. First shot just hurt for 12 hours but nothing compared to the TDAP pain. The second shot, which was administered on March 4th, made the arm hurt for 18 hours after. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s now a dull ache similar to working out. After the second shot there was a small 4 hour window of extreme tiredness and 2 hours of chills. Both of these happened about 18 hours after injection. Still didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t let the side effects stop me from my normal activities.

AKA \"anti-vax\". That's what stopped me initially from running out and getting it before finding out about all the nastiness.\n\nI'm just curious how the people who aren't anti-vax knew to avoid this before the horror stories became available? Was it because it was rushed &amp; experimental?\n\nNote: I can't remember where I heard this, but supposedly Fauci wanted the flu shot to be the big, universal shot everyone got.

As per the Pentagon, all U.S. military members must get the PSYOP-19 “Vax” by September 15th. Yes, the very same “Vax” that as per VAERS reporting at under 1% has murdered and maimed more test subjects than all of the vaccine deaths and injuries **combined** over the past 30 years. The very same “Vax” that damages 100% of all test subjects by inducing endogenous spike protein production, which is cytotoxic. Yes, the very same “Vax” that causes in varying degrees micro-clotting in 100% of test subjects. And let us not delve into the potential for cancer, prion production, premature dementia and a whole host of other suspected and wholly unknown side effects anywhere from 48 weeks to 5 years out. Exactly what a military whose average soldier has around a **99.9%** “COVID” **survivability rate** requires ASAP. A military with to date less than a rounding error of actual “COVID” deaths no less.\n\nYesterday, yours truly had a most disturbing chat with a Special Forces soldier. The gist of the conversation was that “all the good ones” are leaving the U.S Military ahead of September 15th, leaving only those that have no issue getting ‘Vaxxed” only to then commence rounding up any citizen that has declined this experimental gene therapy. Not just a brilliant means of forcing out the Patriots from out of the Armed Forces, but also the maiming and murdering over time of the remaining grunts, and compromised and indoctrinated brass.\n\nThe CIA has been running China ever since their Cultural Revolution was orchestrated by the very same nefarious forces that brought us the Bolshevik Revolution as well as the Nazi Party. As the historically well versed reader may know, the CIA was born from a most devious and depraved marriage between the OSS (Office of Strategic Services, the WW2 proto-spy agency) and their Operation Paperclip poaching of the very best and brightest SS Nazi war criminals that were imported back to America well before the last shots were fired and the cremated remains still smoldering. Ever since the SS Nazis we rolled up into the OSS into the CIA, we have had in America a gang of Fascist spies running this nation.\n\nSo what does the CIA have to do with all of this, and how does it pertain to the CCP’s plans to destroy the USA from within? Who exactly is brainwashing the populace with an **induced mass hypochondria hysteria psyop predicated on junk science**? See Operation Mockingbird. Who is running a “President” with severe dementia? Who ran the ultimate Manchurian Candidate “President” who quite literally materialized out of thin air only to be embedded as POTUS? How about the former POTUS who actually ran the CIA? And so why would the premiere Spy Agency, an extra-Constitutional agency at that. want to destroy the military and the nation it was allegedly tasked with protecting?\n\nThe dying, yet woke U.S. Military is readying to go after the anti”Vaxxers”, patriots, and all other “enemies” of the State. The gulags are being readied all across the nation. And the timing is ingenious, because we are quite literally weeks away from the real Pandemic as a direct function of “Vax” Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE). A perfect confluence of planned events that will justify the reinstatement of Lockdown 2.0 and accelerate the “Great Reset”.\n\nSo why go after the U.S. Military with this “Vax” when there is no risk whatsoever to the soldiers?\n\nWhat do you get when you cross a Fascist Spy Agency with a Communist Superpower?\n\nSick until proven healthy. Sick until injected.\n\nNot a single shot ever needed to be fired…\n\n[https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "negative"}]}

Yesterday we had a 45 yo male patient brought in by the paramedics in full cardiac arrest.  The brief info we got from the paramedic crew was that the patient had no known medical history outside of recently being diagnosed with COVID and had been trying to recover at home. He'd had a sudden episode of difficulty breathing and his wife called 911.  He went in to cardiac arrest in the ambulance.  We worked him in the ER for 30 minutes but couldn't get him back.  \n\nSo as I'm looking at his chart, I realize I know the patient, or rather I know his wife (we went to high school together).  I went to the family privacy room to offer my condolences. It was during our talk that she gave me more of the background.  She said her husband thought COVID was overhyped and been outspoken against the vaccine, and had refused to get it when offered.  He'd been diagnosed with COVID about a week earlier but wouldn't seek medical care outside of getting his personal physician to prescribe the anti-malarial drug  hydroxychloroquine.  He'd been sitting at home for the past week with difficulty breathing getting worse and worse.  When he finally collapsed in to unconsciousness, she called 911.  \n\nWhat made me want to vent about this was reading an article this morning that talked about a member of Congress who'd had his YouTube account suspended for posting COVID misinformation where he railed against the vaccine and touted treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.  He was complaining that he was being censored and that there was no harm in encouraging people to seek alternative treatments.  Well yes, Congressman, there IS harm in suggesting alternative treatments, especially when you tell people they should ignore the CDC and all the medical experts.  \n\nI'm so sad for my friend.  Her husband left her behind with two children under 10.  All because somebody (whether it was a blog, politician, website...whatever) took him down a rabbit hole of conspiracy, covid/vaccine denial, and wackadoodle alternative medicine that ultimately ended in his death."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "positive"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Covid Caution\nAll, I caught Covid, and it caused me to miss a week's worth of work. I am vaccinated, an otherwise healthy person, and I really don't get sick. I was working a festival in a place that had decent Covid protocols... At least for the fans. I got home, took an at-home test 5 days later, and tested negative. Only when I went to get a test to go work my next gig 4 days after my first negative test did I find out I was positive. I was symptomatic at that time, but due to some home repairs, and aggressive exposure to my chief allergen, mold, I thought that was likely the culprit. The actual illness for me wasn't bad. As I said, I really did think it was just seasonal allergies, especially given my negative test. As the mucus load seemed to move more into my chest however I developed a cough and that persisted for about 48 hours. I've been at home for 7 full days and tested negative about half an hour ago.  \n\n  \n\nSo now to what I think I did wrong:  \n\nI was doing monitors for a festival, throw and go, 5-6 bands a day for 3 days. Obviously, the performers were not masked, and this particular festival didn't have any testing requirements for staff or performers. So I was situated for 3 days, exposed to 20+ people a day that may or may not have been positive, all doing an activity that allows for quite a bit of aerosols to be emitted. I was masked, save for when I was drinking water or eating. I think that if I had been more diligent about sanitizing my hands after changeovers, and had I been wearing an N95, or even double masking with an N95 and a 3 ply the chance that I would have caught it would have been greatly reduced.  \n\nI'm proof the vaccine works. I caught a virus that has killed millions of people, and my treatment was Hall's cough drops and rest. I would encourage any of you that are going to be in positions where you're around untested, and/or unmasked populations to double down on your own masking and personal sanitation efforts.

I’m 26F and normal weight, I got COVID 15 months ago and I was no where near dieing. I didn’t have a hard time breathing I didn’t even cough, but I can’t say it didn’t fuck me up on other ways. For 8 months I couldn’t exercise it was like I had chronic fatigue but I started feeling better after 8 months. 15 months later I STILL can’t taste food which I must say has been very depressing and I let myself drop to a very low weight because eating is a chore now…. I absolutely hate this virus for robbing me of my taste for so long….But none of this warrants forced lockdowns or vaccination and the truth is that what I experienced may be rare. Do you want to know why I had these really problems with COVID? Because I DONT take care of myself and it caught up.\n\nWell here comes the part that gets me censored left and right, doctors tell me I’m stressed and I’m not. I’m having side effects from the vaccine. Now I have been a skeptic of the vaccine for some time but when I met people that said their taste came back because of it I decided to take the risk and take it in hopes my taste came back. On top of that I had family pressure to take it anyways. Well not only did it now come back yet I started having some bad side effects. To the point where I never ever want to take another vaccine or “booster” (lol) again.\n\nMy side effects from Pfizer:\n\n1.Chest paint\n2. Heart skipping beats\n3.Tightness in chest\n4.Shortness of breathe\n5. Kidney levels came out weird in bloodwork and they hurt\n6.

In sum, the entire process should take about 30 minutes:\n\n* (1) You enter at the corner of 11th Avenue and 36th Street.\n\n* (2) Upon entrance, they will ask you to provide (a) copy of your ID, and (b) copy/picture of your appointment confirmation.  Processing time will take 0-30 seconds.\n\n* (3) You are then directed to the main convention hall of the Javits Center, following a circuit of colored stripes from one location to the next.  Walking time will take 30-60 seconds.\n\n* (4) The second check in point will place you sitting down opposite an admin type person.  Here they will ask for your ID again, as well as a copy/picture of your appointment confirmation.  The admin person will also ask you a series of question relating to your health and whether you've had any recent symptoms.  If they ask you to provide proof of your co-morbidity, they will ask here - from four friends I can say none were asked to reveal their co-morbidity.  Processing time here will take about 3-5 minutes.\n\n* (5) You will then be directed to another section of the conference hall where you will again be seated, and again you will follow the painted stripes on the floor to your next location.  Walking time of 30 seconds.\n\n* (6) You are now in the \"health\" section where the nurses are.  You will sit down and hand your ID to an admin person who is with the nurse.  You will wait for a vaccine to be brought to your location (can take less than one minute, but can take several minutes if they are changing out vats of vaccines ... for me, I was unfortunate and the waiting time was 15 minutes for a vaccine to be brought to us).  The nurse will then administer the shot, and the admin person will give you a vaccine card that includes a sticker from the vaccine shot as well as the date for the next appointment that will take place three weeks later - keep this vaccine card for your records.  Process should take between 5-10 minutes (but in my unlucky case it took 30 minutes). \n\n* (7) You are then directed to a seating area that is immediately adjacent to the health section.  You are asked to sit here for a full 15 minutes to see if there are any adverse effects before leaving.  It's a little awkward as the seating area is just rows upon rows of individual chairs separated 6 feet apart.  I skipped this part of the process, but through slight .. not sure if you're \"allowed\" to per se.\n\nOverall I was highly impressed with how smooth the process was.

Recovered and am basically back to 100% or close to. Walking around and going about my day like normal. In mid March, I went to check if everything if back to normal  (blood work and general check up (lung x-ray, EKG, etc)). Everything came back normal except for a slightly elevated d-dimer (0.5). My doctor said because covid is a disease of the vasculature, it actually not out of the ordinary. She ruled out DVT and PE based on a clinical probability assessment. I wasn't too worried at that time, I know that a slightly elevated d-dimer can present itself after a disease like covid. I only inquired about my d-dimer because I was looking to start birth control and wanted to make sure I wasn't inviting any unnecessary risks to an already (but slightly) elevated d-dimer. She told me to just wait till my d-dimer stabilizes and get my d-dimer retested end of April or early May. Ok great no problem.\n\nFast-forward to this week. I'm all signed up to get my vaccine. I have been hearing reports about a slight risk of blood clots, and while I understand that it's a very rare/small occurrence, I wanted to make sure that my d-dimer was back to normal before I got the vaccine. So I had my blood work yesterday, and sure enough my d-dimer did decrease (0.48). **But since it is still close to the higher end of the d-dimer threshold (0.48 v. 0.5), I'm wondering if I should be waiting until it dips lower before I get the shot?**  I don't know what the correlation is of people who already had an elevated d-dimer getting blood clots from the shot, and just want to make sure I'm not one of them. To be clear, I'm not trying to be a vaccine denier, I 100% support getting vaccinated. \n\nOther details: Fairly healthy 33 year old female, no birth control, weight 106 lbs, physically active + have a healthy diet.   \n\n\nI really appreciate your thoughts.

It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t scary, I knew they were merely my messed-up imagination, but it really made me think. \n\nIf the vaccine made me feel like this, and it is a severely weakened version of some of the virus proteins or something, what if I caught the real thing?

Why do you act like there is no immoral people in the science community? That's not what I want to talk about. This post is for Americans. Even if all the science was concrete and fact, it would not matter. This is about principle to most of us. Jefferson once said \"those who would trade liberty for security deserve neither\" what you people don't understand is that we see a much larger threat than the virus. We see fascism and excuses for condoning it. You guys have places to go that are just like the system you're asking for. Places like China where you would be forced to be vaccinated and people like us couldn't say what we say because social credit system incentives and penalties. Ok?. So you guys have places to go that fit your ideals. We don't. This is the home of the brave and land of the free (not land of the weak and home of the slave) . And no red blooded American is afraid of some bullshit virus they can't even see OR HAS NOT BEEN ISOLATED AKA PROVING IT EXISTS.  We are afraid of leaving our children a orwellian dystopia. Our fathers and our the fathers before them have died for this land and what it stands for. Nothing will make me take that in vain and I would do the very same for my children and my children's children. I'm telling you right now, we are not abandoning our ideals so you can feel safe.

Both times i had this weird pain in my chest but it did not feel like it was in my heart, it felt like the back of my chest. Right now im experiencing it worse, im legitimately scared because the pain is so bad but its like a sharp pain, goes away for a tiny bit, then come back. This time it feels more centered in my chest. Does anyone have any advice for what I should/can do? Or have any idea what it is? I took like 4 ibuprofen and am thinking about taking a benadryl tablet to hopefully help, its 2am and im like wide awake and not able to sleep cause the pain keeps coming and going. I ate some chicken and rice and i swear for a moment the pain went away, or maybe i was just really enjoying my food. Im so confused tired and in pain at this point idk what to do. I dont think its a heart attack cause im young (although i am overweight woops) and i havent really had any health scares before,!and if it was well this happened before so I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t think iÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™d of just been okay if it was.

Difficile recurrence.\nI'll try to keep this short:\n\n- I have Ulcerative Colitis and have been on Entyvio to maintain remission for several years.\n- Earlier this year, for the first time, I tested positive for c. difficile. I also had a UC flare at the same time, probably as a result of the infection. I took Flagyl, and then Vancomycin. I also took Florastor and haven't stopped taking it. \n- 2 weeks ago I took my first covid vaccine shot (pfizer). \n- I didn't feel much of anything during the day, but later that night, I woke up with abdominal pain, gas etc.\n- From that point, I slid day by day into to what seemed like a UC flare, and then shortly after, it was obvious it was a c diff infection as the kind of bleeding I get from that is different from UC. (nose bleed coloring the entire toilet bowl red, vs maroon mucous).\n\nMy doctor told me that he rarely sees people solve their c diff infections after a single treatment of antibiotics. More common after the 2nd pulsed treatment of vancomycin.\n\nAnyway, I'm putting this out there in case someone else has the same experience. No, its not proof that the vaccine causes anything, it's just my anecdote.
