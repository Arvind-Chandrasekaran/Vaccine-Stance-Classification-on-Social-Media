"mum wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop pestering me after covid vaccine
my (20f) mum wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop annoying me after i got the covid vaccine. She is anti vax but got the vaccine because she needed it to work. I was also anti vax until i got it a few weeks ago. The thing is, she keeps telling everyone that there is Ã¢â‚¬Å“absolutely nothing to be scared aboutÃ¢â‚¬Â when thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just not the reality, there is side affects and rare adverse reactions, everyone knows that. But she goes around telling me and my boyfriend (who is more at risk of myocarditis) that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no side effects?? and then she tells us that she had an ongoing headache for two weeks?? like she literally told me i wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a sore arm and obviously i did have an extremely sore arm after i got it. I know sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to be positive but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really annoying. She even wanted to stay at my boyfriend and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place the night i got it because she literally thought something terrible was going to happen to me, and ever since then she calls me everyday asking if iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m okay from it. i swear she actually thinks itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poison and iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m pissed off",1,neutral,"1,2,3,4,5"

Your choice is invalid when it pertains to others safety. Your rights must be sacrificed for the collective good. Big pharma and government will decide how you handle this pandemic, not you.

"Diseases defeated by vaccines
So, this is a legitimate inquiry, if someone has a good answer please fell free to educate me.

In the past, humans have created vaccines against certain diseases, yes? Smallpox, Polio, we have eliminated these diseases through vaccines. My understanding is that we have destroyed these diseases because vaccination made it so they no longer had a human host to infect and spread through, inoculation starved them of their ability to function. Now, as we know, the new MRNA Covid vaccine doesn't prevent people from contracting or spreading the disease, it is meant to simply reduce symptoms. Functionally, how is this vaccine expected to achieve the same effect as the Polio or Smallpox vaccines? How is it going to be possible to eradicate a disease with a vaccine that doesn't prevent contraction or transmission? Am I missing something or does the entire narrative break down when you look at it like this?",-1,neutral,"1,2,3,4,5"
"Dear Prime Minister..
**Open Letter from UK Christian Leaders to the UK's Prime Minister Concerning Vaccine Passport Proposals** 

To: The Prime Minister Boris Johnson  
**April 2021**  
   
Dear Prime Minister, 

As Christian leaders across a range of denominations, we continue to pray at this time for your government Ã¢â‚¬Å“and all in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignityÃ¢â‚¬Â (1 Timothy 2:2). 

However, we write to you concerning an area of the most serious concern, namely the potential introduction into our society of so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“vaccine passportsÃ¢â‚¬Â which have also been referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVID-status certificatesÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“freedom passesÃ¢â‚¬Â. We are wholly opposed to this suggestion and wish to make three points about the potential consideration of any scheme of this type. 

Firstly, to make vaccination the basis of whether someone is allowed entry to a venue, or participation in an activity, makes no logical sense in terms of protecting others. If the vaccines are highly effective in preventing significant disease, as seems to be the evidence from trial results to date, then those who have been vaccinated have already received protection; there is no benefit to them of other people being vaccinated. Further, since vaccines do not prevent infection *per se* even a vaccinated person could in theory carry and potentially pass on the virus, so to decide someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“safe non-spreaderÃ¢â‚¬Â status on the basis of proof of their immunity to disease is spurious. 

Secondly, the introduction of vaccine passports would constitute an unethical form of coercion and violation of the principle of informed consent. People may have various reasons for being unable or unwilling to receive vaccines currently available including, for some Christians, serious issues of conscience related to the ethics of vaccine manufacture or testing. We risk creating a two-tier society, a medical apartheid in which an underclass of people who decline vaccination are excluded from significant areas of public life. There is also a legitimate fear that this scheme would be the thin end of the wedge leading to a permanent state of affairs in which COVID vaccine status could be expanded to encompass other forms of medical treatment and perhaps even other criteria beyond that. This scheme has the potential to bring about the end of liberal democracy as we know it and to create a surveillance state in which the government uses technology to control certain aspects of citizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives. As such, this constitutes one of the most dangerous policy proposals ever to be made in the history of British politics. 

Finally, as Christian leaders we wish to state that we envisage no circumstances in which we could close our doors to those who do not have a vaccine passport, negative test certificate, or any other Ã¢â‚¬Å“proof of healthÃ¢â‚¬Â. For the Church of Jesus Christ to shut out those deemed by the state to be social undesirables would be anathema to us and a denial of the truth of the Gospel. The message we preach is given by God for all people and consists in nothing other than the free gift of grace offered in Christ Jesus, with the universal call to repentance and faith in him. To deny people entry to hear this life-giving message and to receive this life- giving ministry would be a fundamental betrayal of Christ and the Gospel. Sincere Christian churches and organisations could not do this, and as Christian leaders we would be compelled to resist any such Act of Parliament vigorously. 

We draw your attention to the recent Judicial Review overturning the Scottish GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ban on public worship, which demonstrates that such disproportionate prevention of the right to worship is a clear infringement under Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights. We cannot see how any attempt to prevent people gathering for worship on the basis of either testing or non-vaccination would not similarly be ruled to be a breach. We agree with those members of Parliament who have already voiced opposition to this proposal: that it would be divisive, discriminatory and destructive to introduce any such mandatory health certification into British society. We call on the government to assert strongly and clearly that it will not contemplate this illiberal and dangerous plan, not now and not ever. 

Yours sincerely,

"Government v*ccine distribution
ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost comical watching local, state and federal governments scrambling around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to figure out how to get more people v*ccinated. If only they realized all they have to do is look in a mirror and realize that they themselves are the actual problem. The government is so disconnected with the people they serve they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize how many people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust them especially after all the lies they spewed over the past 17 months. All they had to do when the v*ccine came out was to say here itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available and leave it up to healthcare networks to promote it and distribute it and personal choice to take it and you probably would have seen much higher rates. But nope like everything else the government had to get their hands in it and royally screw it up. They have PSAs running constantly on media, tried giving you free food and cash, had influencers promote it, lied about its efficacy and told you you were going to go die and kill everyone else if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it. It was all wrong and just led to a host of conspiracies and more distrust that there was a bigger thing at play than just trying to end c*vid. Maybe they knew what they were doing all along that people wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take it and we would end up back at square one or maybe they are just so dumb they have no clue how bad they botched it all up. Well here we are staring down the barrel of mandates v*ccines, v*ccine passports to go anywhere, more lockdowns, masks and this seemingly never ending cycle of c*vid where a select few people benefit and everyone else suffers.

"Until the people are more scared of economic collapse, they will focus on COVID.
You know what happens when millions are laid off because of mandates? The economy sours. You know what a sour economy does to the lower and middle class? It makes them angry. 

Hard to focus on masks when you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel your family. 

I know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depressing but economic impact from refusing mandates, mass layoffs and growing self sufficiency makes it more difficult to prop up an already inflated economy.

"I think my HS was triggered by Covid-19 vaccine
I AM NOT ANTI-VAXX. And everyone should get their shot as soon as theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re able. 

But I am a 24 yo female, never had any sign of HS before. 

I was vaccinated with the AstraZeneca/Oxford (not available at US). It has been shown to be the strongest vaccine here in brazil but also really knocks people down with the side effects: fever, cold, trembling, pain, headache (normal side effects from any vaccine, but they show really exacerbated in this case)

well I was devastated for the next 2 days after the first shot. couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even get out of my bed. really never felt worse; but got better

5 days later I noticed the flare. for the first months I thought it was due to razor hair removal, as many of you. it took 4~5 months and 3 doctors to have my diagnosis. 

But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been thinking. It is a condition linked to immune system/inflammation and I had a huge episode of recruiting my immune system the hardest IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever had. It appeared just few days later. 

It is a genetic disease but it has triggers right?

Any thoughts?

Im a type 2 diabetic and got my 3rd (Pfizer) shot on Monday. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been vaccinated for a year now but only got diagnosed since January.

"Does the Covid vaccine effect the bar implant?
Gonna start off by saying I'm fully vaxxed as is my family. 

So I got my second jab of Pfizer yesterday, like everyone else in my family, and my sister (19) had a period yesterday. She's had the bar implant for around a year so it was odd it stopped working as I heard they last 3 years. She said the vaccine stops BC from working which worries me a bit as I'm on the depo shot. I had a look at some (credible) resources and couldn't find anything about it. I saw my doctor as I needed permission to get the vaccine first and nothing was mentioned about the vaccine affecting BC. Can anyone explain why my sister's bar couldve stopped working or if my shot might wear off before it's supposed to? Cheers in advance!",0,positive,"1,2,3,4,5"

I never tested positive for COVID, but now I am interested to see if I had it at some point. Am I able to test for antibodies, or is that moot now that I have the vaccine?

"Covid Vaccine + Tegretol Interactions
So, I'm in the group of people who are recommended get a third dose of vaccine.

On my second dose, I didn't have much if any ill effects from the jab. Not a sore arm, fever or anything. But I had side effects from the Tegretol. I was out of my mind for 4 days, couldn't think straight, couldn't remember anything, sick to my stomach. These are all the symptoms I feel when I'm not on my meds.

I'm hoping to find a group who is on Tegretol and had the vax's. Did anyone by chance experience the same? Did you happen to get a third dose?

I'm utterly terrified about potentially making myself out of my mind getting the third one, but I ultimately need to keep myself safe too. Just looking to get others experiences, the appointment is booked.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Everyone else at my station said they went through the same thing, and that it lasted right at 36 hours.

"Pains months after covid shots?
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a 17f I got my two shot a few months ago and ever since then I have been in constant pain.

When I had gotten my first shot I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel my arm for the next week or so, when I got my second shot how ever that very night I thought I was going to die.

I had an extremely bad fever I was sweating but was cold my lungs felt like they where squeezed together I could not break and every muscle in my body could barely be moved.

Now I have constant joint and muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, swelling and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even get me started when my period comes, I become bed ridden.

I have no idea why this is happening but when I tell my doctor they say IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m fine or that it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t because of the covid vaccine.

Now they are saying we will need a booster shot soon and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m terrified I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be in anymore pain.

And I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know has anyone else gotten Symptoms like that or idk an experience like that after getting the shots?
