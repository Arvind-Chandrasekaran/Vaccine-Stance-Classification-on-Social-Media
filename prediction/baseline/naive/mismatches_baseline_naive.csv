"If you can get the covid-19 vaccine and you haven't you're a bad person and I don't like you.
The vaccine is safe. The vaccine is effective. You must have the three shots or you'll be unemployed and excommunicated from society and rightfully so. 

Your choice is invalid when it pertains to others safety. Your rights must be sacrificed for the collective good. Big pharma and government will decide how you handle this pandemic, not you. You're not a government approved doctor or scientist. You don't know anything. You know how to flip burgers, work in retail or look busy in an office. 

Follow the science. The science is settled yet ever changing. Move with the goalposts. Give up your freedoms and listen to tour your superiors.

Get. The. Jab.

"mum wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop pestering me after covid vaccine
my (20f) mum wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop annoying me after i got the covid vaccine. She is anti vax but got the vaccine because she needed it to work. I was also anti vax until i got it a few weeks ago. The thing is, she keeps telling everyone that there is Ã¢â‚¬Å“absolutely nothing to be scared aboutÃ¢â‚¬Â when thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just not the reality, there is side affects and rare adverse reactions, everyone knows that. But she goes around telling me and my boyfriend (who is more at risk of myocarditis) that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no side effects?? and then she tells us that she had an ongoing headache for two weeks?? like she literally told me i wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a sore arm and obviously i did have an extremely sore arm after i got it. I know sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to be positive but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really annoying. She even wanted to stay at my boyfriend and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place the night i got it because she literally thought something terrible was going to happen to me, and ever since then she calls me everyday asking if iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m okay from it. i swear she actually thinks itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poison and iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m pissed off",1,negative,"1,2,3,4,5"

"Diseases defeated by vaccines
So, this is a legitimate inquiry, if someone has a good answer please fell free to educate me.

In the past, humans have created vaccines against certain diseases, yes? Smallpox, Polio, we have eliminated these diseases through vaccines. My understanding is that we have destroyed these diseases because vaccination made it so they no longer had a human host to infect and spread through, inoculation starved them of their ability to function. Now, as we know, the new MRNA Covid vaccine doesn't prevent people from contracting or spreading the disease, it is meant to simply reduce symptoms. Functionally, how is this vaccine expected to achieve the same effect as the Polio or Smallpox vaccines? How is it going to be possible to eradicate a disease with a vaccine that doesn't prevent contraction or transmission? Am I missing something or does the entire narrative break down when you look at it like this?",-1,neutral,"2,3,4,5"
"Dear Prime Minister..
**Open Letter from UK Christian Leaders to the UK's Prime Minister Concerning Vaccine Passport Proposals** 

To: The Prime Minister Boris Johnson  
**April 2021**  
   
Dear Prime Minister, 

As Christian leaders across a range of denominations, we continue to pray at this time for your government Ã¢â‚¬Å“and all in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignityÃ¢â‚¬Â (1 Timothy 2:2). 

However, we write to you concerning an area of the most serious concern, namely the potential introduction into our society of so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“vaccine passportsÃ¢â‚¬Â which have also been referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVID-status certificatesÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“freedom passesÃ¢â‚¬Â. We are wholly opposed to this suggestion and wish to make three points about the potential consideration of any scheme of this type. 

Firstly, to make vaccination the basis of whether someone is allowed entry to a venue, or participation in an activity, makes no logical sense in terms of protecting others. If the vaccines are highly effective in preventing significant disease, as seems to be the evidence from trial results to date, then those who have been vaccinated have already received protection; there is no benefit to them of other people being vaccinated. Further, since vaccines do not prevent infection *per se* even a vaccinated person could in theory carry and potentially pass on the virus, so to decide someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“safe non-spreaderÃ¢â‚¬Â status on the basis of proof of their immunity to disease is spurious. 

Secondly, the introduction of vaccine passports would constitute an unethical form of coercion and violation of the principle of informed consent. People may have various reasons for being unable or unwilling to receive vaccines currently available including, for some Christians, serious issues of conscience related to the ethics of vaccine manufacture or testing. We risk creating a two-tier society, a medical apartheid in which an underclass of people who decline vaccination are excluded from significant areas of public life. There is also a legitimate fear that this scheme would be the thin end of the wedge leading to a permanent state of affairs in which COVID vaccine status could be expanded to encompass other forms of medical treatment and perhaps even other criteria beyond that. This scheme has the potential to bring about the end of liberal democracy as we know it and to create a surveillance state in which the government uses technology to control certain aspects of citizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives. As such, this constitutes one of the most dangerous policy proposals ever to be made in the history of British politics. 

Finally, as Christian leaders we wish to state that we envisage no circumstances in which we could close our doors to those who do not have a vaccine passport, negative test certificate, or any other Ã¢â‚¬Å“proof of healthÃ¢â‚¬Â. For the Church of Jesus Christ to shut out those deemed by the state to be social undesirables would be anathema to us and a denial of the truth of the Gospel. The message we preach is given by God for all people and consists in nothing other than the free gift of grace offered in Christ Jesus, with the universal call to repentance and faith in him. To deny people entry to hear this life-giving message and to receive this life- giving ministry would be a fundamental betrayal of Christ and the Gospel. Sincere Christian churches and organisations could not do this, and as Christian leaders we would be compelled to resist any such Act of Parliament vigorously. 

We draw your attention to the recent Judicial Review overturning the Scottish GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ban on public worship, which demonstrates that such disproportionate prevention of the right to worship is a clear infringement under Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights. We cannot see how any attempt to prevent people gathering for worship on the basis of either testing or non-vaccination would not similarly be ruled to be a breach. We agree with those members of Parliament who have already voiced opposition to this proposal: that it would be divisive, discriminatory and destructive to introduce any such mandatory health certification into British society. We call on the government to assert strongly and clearly that it will not contemplate this illiberal and dangerous plan, not now and not ever. 

Yours sincerely,

"Frozen Shoulder from 1st Covid Jab. Concerned about All vax jabs going forward.
60F / 5'7/ 215lbs / African American  /Left Sholder       
Meds: Qvar/Nexium/ArmourThyroid (Asthma/Occaisional Gastritis/Hypothyroidism)      
Pre-diabetic: A1C 5.7     
   
After my first covid jab (Pfizer) in Feb., I developed frozen shoulder in Left Arm (I'm right handed.)      
I took the 2nd jab in Right Arm as a result. No issues. 
    
I started PT about 3 weeks after the 2nd jab for about 3 months and now work out on my own. It's about 85% better. I can put my own bra on, and that's a big sign that things are improving... but there are still some limited motion issues and it's still pretty achy.
   
To be honest, I'm concerned about vaccines going forward. Not just Covid Vax... ALL vax's. 
   
What are the chances that my covid booster, if given in my left shoulder, could make my frozen shoulder worse? Should I take the jab in Right Arm again? Are there other places on the body that vaxs can be administered?    
   
I know my ortho md told me diabetics are more predisposed to getting frozen shoulder. I'm pre-diabetic but my a1c has been 5.7 - 5. 8 for several years now. I'm not diabetic, but i guess I'm worried if this pre-diabetic thing could be a contributor.   
   
My sister said she had a similar frozen shoulder reaction 20 years ago and she - at the time - was a competitive biker. Great shape / not diabetic by any shot. Is this hereiditary?    
    
I want to get a flu shot but i'm scared. 60 yr old and i'm pussy-ing out. I'm bummed and concerned about this because the frozen shoulder costs money, (PT) takes time from my day, contributes to bad sleep (I can't sleep on my left side, which is my norm), and frankly, is painful.",0,negative,"1,2,3,4,5"
"Flare up after 2nd Covid vaccine??
Maybe IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m crazy but I was doing so well on Simponi until my Covid vaccines. I started having flare ups again and have not felt well since my last Covid vaccine in March. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been on prednisone off and on and now IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve started methotrexate. I mainly have Axial arthritis. In Nov will be switching to Stelara. Is this just related to my meds not working anymore or is it related to the Covid vaccine causing an immune response and flare up thus leading to my medication becoming in effective?

I just had my first covid vaccine and I was warned that after the vaccine has been injected you may feel a slight pain in your arm.

"Has anyone in here recovered from a breakthrough Covid case yet?
I've been doing everything I can to avoid it, masks, WFH, Pfizer vaccine in April, but I tested positive Friday.  Still pretty angry but mostly worried about not being able to run like I used to.  At a 55k in June my wife picked up a couple dropped runners at an aid station, both had covid earlier and just never got their endurance back.  We did see one of them at another 55k in July, she finished but still said she was not the same as she used to be.  Scares the hell out of me.

From what I understand the breakthrough cases are more mild, and mine has been a mid-grade cold for the most part.  Congestion, fatigue, body aches, a few chills and a small fever, but all in all not too terrible.  Is anyone further out from a breakthrough case and back to running?

Luckily I had my first dose of vaccination, but I feel terrible. My stomach feels empty but my head hurts so much that I feel like I'm going to vomit. 

It came at the worst time, I have a tedtalk speech in a week and I'm losing relevance in my friend group. It's one of those groups that when you stay off for a while everyone forgets you, and when I texted the group chat that I had covid only one person responded. 

I'm dealing with terrible depression and PTSD, being in school was a distraction, and I'm terrified that covid would make my exhaustion somehow worse for months because I heard people suffer the consequences for so long. 

Just needed a place to be whiny, thank you for coming to my tedtalk.",0,positive,"1,2,3,4,5"

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Everyone else at my station said they went through the same thing, and that it lasted right at 36 hours.

"Pains months after covid shots?
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a 17f I got my two shot a few months ago and ever since then I have been in constant pain.

When I had gotten my first shot I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel my arm for the next week or so, when I got my second shot how ever that very night I thought I was going to die.

I had an extremely bad fever I was sweating but was cold my lungs felt like they where squeezed together I could not break and every muscle in my body could barely be moved.

Now I have constant joint and muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, swelling and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even get me started when my period comes, I become bed ridden.

I have no idea why this is happening but when I tell my doctor they say IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m fine or that it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t because of the covid vaccine.

Now they are saying we will need a booster shot soon and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m terrified I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be in anymore pain.

And I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know has anyone else gotten Symptoms like that or idk an experience like that after getting the shots? 

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also not hating on the vaccine IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m glad I got it I would get it again knowing I could potentially feel like this again, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll more then likely get the booster.",0,positive,"2,3,4,5"

"Sick with COVID 9 months ago, blacked out after first Pfizer dose with strange symptoms.
Long story short, I got infected with COVID about 9 months ago. Fast forward to yesterday when I received my first Pfizer dose and I honestly thought I was dying.

The first few minutes were fine, I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t freaking out beforehand. As soon as I started talking to my mom (who was sitting next to me), my vision started blacking out, it was hard to breathe, cold sweats and I felt this really strange sensation throughout my body. The best way I can describe it is warm waves starting from my head and slowly making their way down to my feet. This went on for a few minutes.

I was totally incoherent and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t move a muscle. All I remember is my mom and the nurses talking at me and being incapable of responding.

About half an hour later I felt better, but I was still dizzy and nauseous throughout the day. Needless to say, I did NOT expect this type of reaction. Everyone I know who has received their first dose said they essentially felt nothing other than the typical symptoms. 

I was the only one out of my close friends and family to get sick with COVID.

Is it possible that my body might have too many antibodies from being sick before? My case was pretty serious and I was suffering from long COVID up until this summer.

Needless to say, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m scared shitless for my second dose. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to hear your opinions/stories on whether this is a bad reaction to the vaccine itself or something else. WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to see my doctor for at least a month.",0,negative,"1,2,3,4,5"
"[30F] Pfizer COVID Booster (3rd dose)
Just wanted to share my experience with the Pfizer COVID booster (3rd dose) so far. I (30F, immunocompromised) work in healthcare and got my second dose of Pfizer mid-March. I got my booster around 4pm yesterday and within 3 hours my arm was very sore and I was getting a mild headache, and drowsiness. By 9pm that night my arm was much more sore and I was easily able to just knock out (normally I struggle with insomnia) and my headache was getting worse. This morning I woke up about 630am and my headache was pretty severe, to the point where Excedrin and Ibuprofen weren't doing anything, and my arm was very sore (no swelling or redness though), plus some nausea. My headache is almost unbearable at this point, my arm is still very sore, I feel a little fatigued, and I've had diarrhea. So far I've had less of a reaction than I did to my second dose. Within 12 hours of getting my second dose I was running a high fever, had a severe headache with body aches, diarrhea and severe fatigue - but it only lasted about 24 hours and I was good to go. My first dose I had a little arm soreness and a headache, but was otherwise fine.

Fingers crossed it doesn't get much worse than this and that the weekend isn't completely ruined, haha. In two weeks I'll be allowed to get my flu vaccine.

UPDATE: over 24 hours later - sore arm, nausea and vomited once, headache, severe fatigue, decreased appetite, mild body aches. Still hanging in there and happy there has been no fever so far.

48 hours later: Arm in minimally sore, no body aches but still mildly nauseous with fatigue and a headache. Headache definitely isn't as bad as yesterday. Overall feeling MUCH better. My appetite is also still decreased, but I'm not really gonna complain about that.",0,positive,"1,2,3,4,5"
