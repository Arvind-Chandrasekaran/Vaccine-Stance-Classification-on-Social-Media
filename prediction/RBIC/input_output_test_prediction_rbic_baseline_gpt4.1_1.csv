"COVID Booster- have you or will you get one during IVF?
This question is probably only relevant to a limited audience. For non- healthcare workers and those not part of the current CDC groups recommendations for booster shot, who are vaccinated individuals going through IVF, are you getting or have you gotten a booster shot for COVID at the recommendation of your dr? My dr suggested I get one prior to FET. My clinic is very covid cautious and says we are all going to need a booster they are just staging out who gets one right now. My Pfizer shot #2 was back in February. Not trying to stir up a vaccine do or donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t conversation here, I want one, but also feel bad skipping the line since itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seems like fuzzy territory if I fall into the at risk groups? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not a dr or nurse or even a teacher..I work in an office! Feels like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m hogging the immunization. And should I expect any trouble asking for it at the pharmacy?

Update thank u to all who responded, I am not hesitant and just scheduled to get a booster this week! Good luck and good health to all!!",1,positive
"Now instating COVID-19 treatment waiting lists and medical fees for anti-vaxers
Simply put, life is going back to normal.

Everyone can choose whether or not to wear a mask and/or get vaccinated. Those who choose not to get vaccinated, however, will receive the lowest priority rating if they require medical attention for COVID-related health issues. Similar to organ transplant lists, anti-vax COVID-19 patients will have to see if there is an opening in an advanced medical facility before admittance. Hospitals are not to be bothered with doing triage and ""making room"" for preventable conditions. Exempted are persons who are not able to receive the vaccine due to not meeting vaccination requirements (ex. physician-verified health condition, vaccine unavailability for demographic, etc). Basically, priority for medical care is as follows (from lowest to highest): anti-vax who come in for COVID-related reasons, anti-vax who test positive and come in for non-COVID-related reasons, and everyone else.

If you are anti-vax and come in for non-COVID-related reasons, you will be charged a minimum of $500 for extra disinfection protocols and toward a relief fund ($5000 if you test positive). If you are fully vaccinated but require treatment for COVID-19, not only is your treatment free, but you will be awarded damages via the relief fund.  


Should morgues, funeral homes, and crematoriums become overwhelmed, anti-vax persons' remains may be subject to an unceremonious, anonymous disposal (ex. unknown, unmarked mass grave). Their family members are not entitled to neither possession or knowledge of the remains.",1,positive

"How effective are Pfizer vaccines in the Immunosuppressed against COVID-19?
The CDC has recommended the Immunosuppressed take an extra 3rd dose of Pfizer to better protect against COVID-19. From my understanding, this is because the vaccine tends to be less effective in such individuals, where less antibodies are formed, compared with the general population.

Even in the general population, the Pfizer vaccine is showing as less effective after 6 months.

"Has anyone in here recovered from a breakthrough Covid case yet?
I've been doing everything I can to avoid it, masks, WFH, Pfizer vaccine in April, but I tested positive Friday.  Still pretty angry but mostly worried about not being able to run like I used to.  At a 55k in June my wife picked up a couple dropped runners at an aid station, both had covid earlier and just never got their endurance back.  We did see one of them at another 55k in July, she finished but still said she was not the same as she used to be.  Scares the hell out of me.

From what I understand the breakthrough cases are more mild, and mine has been a mid-grade cold for the most part.  Congestion, fatigue, body aches, a few chills and a small fever, but all in all not too terrible.  Is anyone further out from a breakthrough case and back to running?  If so, how are you feeling?",0,positive
"IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell it now: IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had COVID for the past week.
So last Sunday my wife started feeling sick and tested positive for COVID and 24 hours the same thing happened with me.  

Tuesday through Friday felt like a flu of about a 7 out of 10 in terms of intensity, not exactly pleasant, but not debilitating or life threatening either. Yesterday I started turning the corner and today IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m about 85-90% back to normal. Although IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve completely lost my sense of smell, which is a really weird sensation. My wife has followed a similar recovery pattern. 

Here are my two big takeaways from the experience. 

First, obviously, is thank God both my wife and I were vaccinated. It scares my to think how this thing could have gone we hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gotten the vaccine back in March. Especially when I think how my children could have possibly been facing the prospect of losing one or both parents. 

My other takeaway is that this pandemic still has a long way to go and, even with all the HCA nominees/winners weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already had, there are going to be A LOT more in the future. My wife and I were vaccinated, are in very good overall health, have to wear masks at work and are both generally very cautious and diligent about trying to do things to limit out exposure. Yet, even with  all those things, COVID still got to us eventually. 

A lot these stupid assholes who, despite everything that has happened, are still out there taunting the virus while proudly flaunting their selfishness and irresponsible actions, are going to pay dearly for it sooner or later. Personally I believe the next 5-6 months are going to be absolutely brutal.

[Why Brazil Beat the U.S. in COVID Vaccination](https://www.thedailybeast.com/brazil-ignored-jair-bolsonaro-to-beat-the-us-in-covid-19-vaccination)

""In the late 1960s, with smallpox still circulating in the country, the then-ruling military dictatorship established the guiding characteristics that would shape Brazilian vaccine campaigns for decades to come. In a renewed effort to eradicate the disease, the government tapped community leadersÃ¢â‚¬â€local politicians, religious leaders, athletesÃ¢â‚¬â€and a variety of communication channels, including newspapers, loudspeakers, and films screened on school campuses, to get their message out. In large cities, mass vaccinations took place in iconic public spaces. Popular festivals, processions, religious services, fairs, and artistic performances became vaccination sites. Vaccines even reached distant countryside towns. Hochman explained that by the end of the campaign, 84 percent of Brazilians were inoculated, smallpox had been eradicated, and the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s citizens had come to view vaccinations as a public good from the state. The military dictatorship doubled down on those efforts when it created the National Immunization Program in 1973.

A decade and a half later, with the country back under civilian rule, Brazil established what is now the largest universal public health system in the world, the Unified Health System. Although it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t perfect, it has established the government as a trusted provider of basic free health care to the communities who need it most. Anyone in Brazil can walk into a public clinic and receive any of more than 20 vaccinations for free.""

With all that being said, no matter what beliefs we hold or what side of the political spectrum we are in, the pain of death of a loved one is a universal experience. In this day and age, thanks to social media, it is very easy to figure out who your friends and family are. Sharing the username and picture of the people who died from refusing vaccines, can bring unwelcome attention to the close ones of the deceased and puts them in a weird position at the time of grief.

This still makes me nervous for my baby. I think that if things were very serious, she would downplay it because she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to discourage us from coming up there any later (she wants to meet her grandson).

Of course, my babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safety comes first, before everything. I am vaccinated, my boyfriend is not, yet. He wants to get it when we make the move.

Without going into detail, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll just say that I lost a sense of control which caused trauma and many therapy sessions in the coming years. 

The therapy started with me talking about my feelings, why I feel the way I do towards medical needles, and eventually we had exposure therapy etc. None of this seemed to work as even the thought of needles had me falling apart and hyperventilating. I thought I was a lost case, and told myself Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I am in a life or death situation where the solution is a vaccine, I will accept death.Ã¢â‚¬Â That was a sad thought to have at my young age and it brought me into depression.

It is just several years of therapy. Trying to get a vaccine, but not being able to despite being on anxiety reducing medicines (prescribed). I even had to set aside a family trip because I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take the vaccines required to go.

Finally the truth came out when I saw on her paperwork she was admitted on September 2nd. Then my mom snapped and said yes she had covid okay and you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what I HAVE been through. I said okay what? And she said she was extremely sick from august 19 for 3 weeks with a fever and now has blood clots in her legs and lungs and pneumonia. I said omg you had covid first and gave it to her. She said no I had a negative test.

MotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiancÃƒÂ© (who is there everyday) never had covid but I have texts from her in august saying he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel well and had swollen testicles which is actually a covid symptom.

My mom said they had been staying home 30 days before getting sick but I checked her FB and she had pictures at Texas Roadhouse in august 14. Then she said they never stopped going out and was referring to when they got sick (which is to be expected). 

I visited my grandma and she was sweet of course but my mom and grandma have always been like this and I told my mom to let me ask questions bht she keeps yelling at me and saying IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m abusing her.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and can advise how to go about this? I feel horrible wasting hospitals time just for a lil jab so if anyone has any advice please let me know! 

Thank you in advance",1,positive
"One of my best friends is in a trauma center with Covid, and other friends are still in denial, and my dad is in La La Land.
One of my oldest friends who was sucked into all of the Q-Anonsense covid denialism and who has been posting COVID and vaccine denying nonsense for over a year landed himself in an ICU and is near death. 

He suddenly seems to have no recollection of all of his denialism but seems genuinely remorseful and has repeatedly asked me to recall the things he said. I sent him a pretty firmly worded message, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not gonna lie man IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m kind of pissed at you. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been spreading Covid misinformation and shit for a long time. And IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried to talk sense into you repeatedly before I had to finally Unfollow you. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been into ICU wards and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen this shit firsthand many times. My girlfriend has watched dozens of people die from it. It hurt my heart to see the shit that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been posting for the last year. Anyway IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not gonna hold it against you, but I just have to tell you how I feel. I have compassion for you but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also kind of pissed cause youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been super irresponsible with the things youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been saying online.Ã¢â‚¬Â

He actually responded pretty well to my message and was apologetic and acknowledged that he was wrong about COVID but seemed to forget the hundreds of posts heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made denying COVID was even real. 

The kicker for me tonight though was at a bonfire another buddy of mine (not super close) doubled down on his QAnonsense and started shouting at me telling me ICUs are where people go to die, and if my friend wanted to get better he shouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just stayed home. Saying COVID was the flu and spouting off about the Mark of the Beast and  whole bunch of other asinine BS.

This is particularly insulting because my girlfriend is an amazing ICU nurse who puts her heart and soul into her job every day, and watches people die of COVID, several times a week. My buddy called 911 because he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t breathe. He didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get dragged into the ICU. He asked to be taken there. I guarantee the doctors and nurses there are doing their level best to keep him alive. And he admitted that he was close to death.

I split my time between two different places and I have two very distinct sets of friends, one of which are very science and reality respecting, and the other are the total opposite. And in republican country itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become almost a given that people get sucked into QAnon. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no longer just right wing conservatism / gun rights / anti abortion nonsense, it has descended into all out assault on decency and rational thinking.

My dad, who I had always held in high regard, has also fallen prey into this nonsense. One day itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Donald Trump has already been reinstated as presidentÃ¢â‚¬Â and the next it is Ã¢â‚¬Å“The government of Australia has fallenÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Clintons have committed suicide.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Well, my sister lives in Australia and quickly debunked that one quickly. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost as if reality just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even matter anymore. Tom Hanks also committed suicidal a while back.

"Covid anti-vaxers - why?
Honest-to-God question, purely curious. For me the vaccine is purely a question of cost (i.e. negative impact on me) vs benefit (protection from disease).

By now I've read numerous papers on the vaccines, including the science behind them. Given the now substantial amount of statistical information that has been collected on the vaccines and their impact, and a truly enormous number of studies on covid-19, I'm near-to-100% convinced taking the vaccine is to my benefit (noting I'm about to hit 50).

If you're a little younger, then having the vaccine will likely substantially reduce the likelihood of suffering from some form of long-covid.

Certainly compared to the negatives of covid-19, any negatives from the vaccines (particularly the pfizer vaccine) are statistically outweighed.

The delta variant is now known to be worse than the alpha variant in terms of the likelihood of hospitalisation.

I can see why some people would be irked by effectively being told, like a child, to have the vaccine. However, again, in terms of a cost-benefit analysis, taking the vaccine is (for most people) the rational decision.

So - why are you anti-covid vax?

**Note:** I'm a little on the spectrum, and the reasons behind people's behaviour aren't alway obvious to me. This is not a troll or shitpost.

**Addendum:**  My  intent is to read every response and summarise the contents of this thread into the original post (here). However, this has blown out way beyond my expectation, so  this may take a while!",1,positive
"My friend is hospitalized with COVID-19, and no, it doesn't look like she's going to make it.
I feel at such a loss. Three weeks ago I found out my friend was sick - just a cold, she said, or maybe allergies. Today I'm sitting awake 1:17 AM after receiving a call from her mom. Her oxygen dipped into the low 80's - the vent is back at 100% assistance. 

She has been my best friend since we were 9. We're 24 now. Just learning how to live our lives, and we have so many plans, so many things to experience. I begged her to go get tested, I begged her to get the vaccine. This isn't going to turn into anything about the vaccine, so please don't comment about it. Yet, here she lays with a machine breathing for her. 

She's never had her first kiss, believe or not. She's never had a boyfriend. She wants kids, and she's great with kids. I'm texting her every single day, several times a day, for her to see when she wakes up. I started on Monday, when I learned that she had been placed on a vent. Unfortunately, the feeling of her not making it gets stronger each day. I finally had some hope today. Finally I allowed myself to feel it, and finally, I got a text at midnight. ""Her O2 dipped. We need prayers."" 

My heart shattered into a million tiny pieces. I thought maybe we were going to get a break. She's been hospitalized for nearly three weeks, and the odds seem to be pushing and pushing, trying to make her fall. 

I just need her. She listens to everything, and we laugh nonstop. I just want to talk to her. I just want to hear her voice. I want that last minute call ""do you want to go to Target with me?"" I want my friend and I'm so scared that I might lose her.",1,positive
"Asking people to get Vaccinated for covid
Bit of background   
I live in South Australia, we aren't overly dealing with covid cases like other states and countires.   
I'm 35 weeks pregnant and I recently got my second Pfizer Vaccination.   


In Australia it is standard to ask family and friends to get the whooping cough vaccine (dTpa) before they meet the baby or wait until baby has had the vaccinations themselves. This is easy because like I said its standard to ask people.   


What I'm stuck with is do I or don't I ask people to get Covid Vaccinated (We have Pfizer, AstraZebeca and Moderna availible in Aus). It is a really sensative topic here as I can imagine it is within other countries. What I want to know is have people asked others to get it before meeting baby or have you just left it?

I'm masking at all times I'm around others, double vaxxed, keeping social distance. Plus I'm heading for an area with high vaccination rates until this shit show is over.

I got vaccinated back in March and April (Pfizer). IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 12 weeks pregnant today and already diagnosed with gestational diabetes. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also overweight. I asked my dr when I should get the booster since I am in several high risk categories. They said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine to get it when I reach my second trimester which is coming up but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a scenario where I absolutely need to get the booster ASAP. However I asked them if antibodies would pass to the baby if I get vaccinated in my second trimester they said they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if it is like tdap where the antibodies pass later in pregnancy. I would prefer to wait a bit if antibodies donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pass until later in pregnancy but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have this information.

"My sister caught covid near the end of September and my mom is strictly anti covid vaccine.
For the record, I am vaccinated (Moderna). Up until my sister's diagnosis I have been indifferent to my mother's views on covid, and have expressed to her my views which she repeatedly rebuffed and dismissed. 

My sister wasn't vaccinated either and she was admitted to the hospital maybe 2 days after she started showing symptoms. The next day they put her on a ventilator and as of right now she is still on the vent and is now getting the trach. My sister is morbidly obese and I am hoping that she will make it through. 

My mother had taken a break from posting her ""my body, my choice"" nazi party of canada and i was happy. Now she is back to posting this bullshit again while her own daughter is suffering in the ICU with covid. I have never been more angry and hurt.

"Just got my COVID booster- my Pfizer experience for anyone who is on the fenceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
I have been pregnant for ALL of my COVID shots. I got Pfizer shots 1 &amp; 2 at 4 &amp; 7 weeks pregnant. Today, I got my booster at 32 weeks, 5 days. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m here sharing my experience if it can help save a life and alleviate any fears anyone may have about getting the vaccine while pregnant. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in a unique position to share as I have had all 3 shots now during pregnancy. 

Shot 1 (4 weeks pregnant)- sore arm, minor fatigue (this was right before I found out I was pregnant, so the fatigue could have been a pregnancy symptom too.) 

Shot 2 (7 weeks pregnant)- I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a fever, but I did have Tylenol on deck just in case. I felt fluish the day after and felt fine the following day. I chugged a bunch of Liquid IV both before and after my shot. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if it helped, but I would like to think it did. The nurse who gave me my shot recommended staying very hydrated, so I complied. 

Shot 3 (32 weeks, 5 days) - so far, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel anything, but I will keep you posted as to my symptoms if I have any, and I will update after my next OB appt (next week) re the status of my baby (so far, all is well/normal).

Update/Edit: Feeling MILD flu symptoms. No fever- just a little bit of a headache and fatigue. I carved out time to rest and drink fluids, so thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the plan. Baby girl is moving normally at her normal times, so she seems ok, too.

Update/Edit 2 (10/18/21): Baby is fine. She has a strong heartbeat and is moving normally. Nothing out of the ordinary or that would indicate the booster gave her anything but COVID antibodies. As for me, I only felt VERY mildly flu-ish the day after my booster. I actually felt much better than I did after shot 2. Hopefully this helps anyone who might be scared. It really wasn't too bad and all is well with baby.",1,positive

"Pediatrician Talked Niece Out of COVID Vaccination and I am Furious
After a lot of direct talk from yours truly, my mildly anti-vax (and not very bright) sister-in-law finally agreed to get my 12-year-old niece vaccinated, since she's back in real school this year.\*  So she took her to her pediatrician, and apparently this asshole told her that he didn't recommend that she get it, so of course she didn't.  My niece has no underlying health conditions that would prevent her from getting the shot.  Allegedly he told my SIL that (a) there is a better vaccine coming out next year and she should wait for that (what?  I'm pretty up on things and I've heard nothing of this) and (b) since she had OG COVID last December she should have natural antibodies and those were better than immunity from the vaccine (completely false).

I'm so fucking furious.

And of course SIL has multiple co-morbidities and won't get vaccinated either, because she's ""researched"" information from ""both sides.""  So there is a reasonable chance that we'll be inheriting an orphaned 12-year-old here in the next few months because of pure stupidity.

(\* In-person school.  Last year she was ""home schooled"" and basically learned nothing.  She only passed because I spent a couple of weeks dragging her through 5th-grade math.

"It's just dawned on me how coldly calculating the ""how to deal with vaccine hesitant people"" articles are...
Out of curiosity I sometimes like to go read through the msm articles to get some idea of what the enemy is up to. Today I thought it'd be interesting to check out what they're saying about hesitancy, and was unsurprised to find them way off the mark on basically all fronts. Initially I found it amusing, ""these people have no clue"" I thought to myself, but then I began to process things in my head, and ask myself why they'd run articles that are so woefully inaccurate if their apparent goal was to get more people to take the vax.

That's when I had a pretty dark realization; they're not ignorant at all, **the inaccuracy is deliberate**. They know that if they were honest about all the reasons we're ""hesitant"", they risk accidentally red-pilling the sheep by ""signal boosting"" our message. They also know that they don't have any real answers for our concerns, because the answers would most likely vindicate us.

These articles are not an attempt to give the pro-vaxxers ammunition to fight the ""hesitancy"" they encounter in their social circles. What they are, in fact, is propaganda, intended to paint the skeptics as being silly unreasonable twits with mere trivial concerns. They want to make sure that the people they've convinced remain convinced, and do not become curious about that group over there who are resisting.

I keep hearing in the course of the vaccine push that even though I have natural immunity from the OG covid, the scary delta strain is lurking in the shadows and that I need the vaccine because my soft, shitty body isn't powerful enough to fight delta on its own.

My question is this: What exactly is the mechanism of action that causes the vaccine (which was developed to fight regular ol' vanilla covid before delta was a sparkle in its host cell's endoplasmic reticulum) to fight a variant of a pathogen better than natural immunity?

I have yet to receive a straight answer on this from anyone. For that matter, from my understanding of the technology behind the vaccine really the only difference from a ""classic"" vaccine is that instead of injecting you with remnants of dead viral matter, they inject you with the ""programming"" to have your cells around the injection site manufacture the viral matter themselves. 

Now I could be off or missing a big piece of the puzzle here. I just fail to logically see how it could be possible that Pfizer's spike proteins train your immune system better than Wuhan's spike proteins.

"Government v*ccine distribution
ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost comical watching local, state and federal governments scrambling around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to figure out how to get more people v*ccinated. If only they realized all they have to do is look in a mirror and realize that they themselves are the actual problem. The government is so disconnected with the people they serve they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize how many people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust them especially after all the lies they spewed over the past 17 months. All they had to do when the v*ccine came out was to say here itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available and leave it up to healthcare networks to promote it and distribute it and personal choice to take it and you probably would have seen much higher rates. But nope like everything else the government had to get their hands in it and royally screw it up. They have PSAs running constantly on media, tried giving you free food and cash, had influencers promote it, lied about its efficacy and told you you were going to go die and kill everyone else if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it. It was all wrong and just led to a host of conspiracies and more distrust that there was a bigger thing at play than just trying to end c*vid. Maybe they knew what they were doing all along that people wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take it and we would end up back at square one or maybe they are just so dumb they have no clue how bad they botched it all up. Well here we are staring down the barrel of mandates v*ccines, v*ccine passports to go anywhere, more lockdowns, masks and this seemingly never ending cycle of c*vid where a select few people benefit and everyone else suffers. Welcome to building back better and the new normal!",-1,Negative
"Anyone seen a study that vaxxed are transmitting covid to unvaxxed?
I am unfortunately late to awakening, I am fully vaxxed and regret it. I will not get any booster jabs in the future period. I'm a home health caregiver and was doondoggled into taking the vaxx very early on. My son, and other 20 something folks have related to me that they are seeing a lot of there friends getting the delta variant. I have a sneaking dread that this was the evil bastards plan all along.

It just got me wondering what everyone's limit is. I mean, if I get the shot I'm potentially dead or useless to my family. They're better off living with me in poverty than me not being here.",-1,negative
"Diseases defeated by vaccines
So, this is a legitimate inquiry, if someone has a good answer please fell free to educate me.

In the past, humans have created vaccines against certain diseases, yes? Smallpox, Polio, we have eliminated these diseases through vaccines. My understanding is that we have destroyed these diseases because vaccination made it so they no longer had a human host to infect and spread through, inoculation starved them of their ability to function. Now, as we know, the new MRNA Covid vaccine doesn't prevent people from contracting or spreading the disease, it is meant to simply reduce symptoms. Functionally, how is this vaccine expected to achieve the same effect as the Polio or Smallpox vaccines? How is it going to be possible to eradicate a disease with a vaccine that doesn't prevent contraction or transmission? Am I missing something or does the entire narrative break down when you look at it like this?",-1,neutral
"How worried should we be?
So I'm one of 4 of my friends who hasn't taken the fauci fraud jab, how worried should I be abt my friends and even family creating an issue for me with spike protiens...my kids aren't vaxd nor will they be but they spend time with their jabbed grandparents, and I spend time with my jabbed friends...so how much transmission occurs with spike protein and am I just fucked for hanging out with them ( also in all fairness my fam and friends are reasonable ppl who don't push this shit I'm just worried abt vaccine contaigen )  I'm honestly more scared of hanging out with ppl who have it than those who don't

"Government Motivations for renewed lockdown hysteria?
This latest hysterical push to tighten the screws is disturbing, I'm trying to put myself in their shoes and I'm coming up with two scenarios, wonder what you all think. 

1. The vax itself isn't a mass killer or as harmful as speculated on here. Yes it will harm way more than a ""medicine"" should but ultimately they just want to implement total digital surveillance and social credit score type system, this gives them the premise to do it. what the vax does or doesn't do doesn't really matter to them. mRNA was an unethical experiment but not much else.

2. They realized the vax is way worse than predicted, and all the ADE/spike protein stuff is going to kill tens of millions of people who took it within the next couple years, the coming winter probably kicking it off. So in a panic they're trying to cover their tracks so they can blame some ""exotic variant"" if everyone was vaxed. With so many unvaxxed it becomes obvious the government poisoned them and we're facing a literal collapse and mass die off. They're preemptively conditioning everyone to blame unvaxxed and demand segregation camps and whatnot because they know this winter the mass die offs start and can't have normies blaming government 

What do you all think? I'm open minded. Given how aggressive they've been, I think #2 has a decent chance of occuring.",-1,negative
"New variant in Florida?
Duh!

Remember the lysol can posts in the beginning of the pandemic of old lysol cans promoting it kills coronavirus?

"Until the people are more scared of economic collapse, they will focus on COVID.
You know what happens when millions are laid off because of mandates? The economy sours. You know what a sour economy does to the lower and middle class? It makes them angry. 

Hard to focus on masks when you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel your family. 

I know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depressing but economic impact from refusing mandates, mass layoffs and growing self sufficiency makes it more difficult to prop up an already inflated economy.

"Time is of the essence; what can we do to take action?
Firstly, before we get banned or quarantined as a subreddit, we need to still continue to connect somewhere. 

Possibly off social media. 

We are going to need to take action. We will be needing to storm the streets of major cities across the country protesting our resistance. 

We need to be as organized as them. No one is useless. There is always something you can do with your skill. 

The US is slowly taking away our freedoms, this is what its been about the whole time. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already slowly taking away our guns and getting comfortable requiring us to comply with their ridiculous demands. Its about power and control, not the safety of the people and their not about to stop pushing. 

Their strategy is to slowly push, hoping we just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice, and when people resist they push back a bit, wait a while, then push harder the next time around. 

TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going back to masks now but eventually they will develop a vaccine that Ã¢â‚¬ËœdoesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ work. If you ask me, masks were never about stopping the spread, they were about submission just like the vaccine. The stay at home orders and putting everyone on unemployment were about destroying the economy. 

If there is really anybody we should be pointing fingers at, its the Ã¢â‚¬ËœElites,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Biden, the CCP, and other corrupt governments around the world abusing their people, who have strategically created or encouraged this virus and spread it across the world in order to carry out their plan of getting the entire world to submit out of fear. The release of Corona virus, was no accident, anybody who actually believes it was bat soup is a fool. This was a genius, well thought out design to commit mass genocide and strike fear in peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hearts. This was the start of a war. They were hoping to get away with killing people without blood on their hands. 

If you think all the events that followed this virus around the world is a coincidence, its not. BLM before election year, Hong KongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riots, CubaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resistance to their government, South AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looting, the Chinese Social Credit System and so on was no accident. The occurrence of these events, the division of the people during the pandemic, is no coincidence. 

We will be resisting again and fighting back in the same position we are now when a new improved vaccine is developed. They will slowly make it mandatory for people to take the new and improved vaccine, they will assume there should be no excuses because it works. They will start by saying you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go to work, then school, then the the grocery store, its about segregation. Its not about whether the vaccine works or not, it never was. We need to be ready for this fight and we need to be organized and strong. 

There are those with families that are struggling to decipher whether or not they should fight the vaccine mandates their workplaces are putting in place, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be an even bigger push when the vaccines are improved. Lets fight for them and our country before it goes too far. If you can afford to leave your job if it come down to that (hopefully it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t), help us fight.

If some of us donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand up now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be a lot worse for the future. Its not like we want a war or that we all desire chaos, but I also donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be living under a social credit system in a few years either because it will happen. We need to come together with other countries and fight this, the resistance is not just among Americans. We in this community are not crazy, we see it for what it is.

"Is anyone else learning about where their moral hard line is in wake of these vaccine passports and forced vaccines? A hill they would literally die on.
I don't know how else to put it, I remember last year when we got all the original mask mandates and social distancing, I HATED that shit and told everyone how stupid it was but to some degree I still wore a mask (most of the time but not always), it wasn't something I was willing to die fighting over. However now with the ideas being floated of forced vaccinations or passports I've come to terms with dying on this hill/

It's a weird sense of calm I've felt over it this past week or two where before I only felt a tremendous sense of stress and anxiety, it's something I haven't felt in a very long time. I figure if I lose my job I'll figure something else out, if I get barred from the gym I'll make a home gym, if I can't go to restaurants I'll cook my own good shit and out of all if they try to force the vaccine on me they better kill me because I will fight tooth and nail till' my last breath to stop them.

"Say no to VACCINE PASSPORTS
The mere mention of vaccination passports or papers 18 months ago to enter any sort of societal-based establishment was immediately dismissed by the public and elitist officials as nonsensical or down-right conspiracy theorem. This coherently begs the question, if these undemocratic, liberty-busting methods of ""public safety"" can be thrown across entire civilizations under the guise of fear and behavioral science, where do we draw the line? Once passports are normalized, could they morph into something more radical?

Stumble into the present, the same government and elitist officials label those against the use of vaccine papers as selfish conspiracy theorists pushing this narrative throughout the media arms which eventually filters down to the public. The public has now struck gold as the mental gymnastics Olympics often unwilling to venture outside their short-sighted view of reality and into the cuffs of the matrix.

I can understand the short-sightedness of the general public. (whilst extremely frustrating and puzzling for those that are able to sit on the cuffs of this reality)

Government behavioral science and the collusion of propaganda fuelled fear into everyday citizens pushing the narrative that the virus is a threat to civilization. After all, no fear, no compliance with lockdown restrictions and vaccination requests.

Now, I won't go into detail in regards to the use of psychology and behavioral science in order to manipulate the masses and whether it was ethical. But there is an article here on the methods witnessed throughout the last 18 months. [Click](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0884-z).

Now, there is a famous quotation. **Never let a good crisis go to waste.** The control of civilizations with fear under the illusion of safety becomes normalized. Policies the public would have revolutionized against 18 months prior are now accepted and supported and those with critiquing opinions are dismissed or silenced. Do we want to live in a society where potentially ground-breaking ideas are silenced? Some of the most incredible revolutions and changes came from those on the fringes of society with alternate opinions to the mainstream status quo.

Do you want to live in a society where the status quo completely eradicates liberty, the expression of alternate opinion, and the right to be able to decide what's in you and your family's best interest? You think tyranny can't function in the west. You've been conditioned to believe that these ideals are reserved for countries such as China. But it's happening and it's here under the guise of safety.

Vaccine passports as a condition for societal normalcy are the single biggest assault on individual liberty in western politics. This goes beyond left-right politics. This ventures beyond the vaccinated/unvaccinated denominator. All groups should be alarmed.

&amp;#x200B;

The gravest concern here is the direction we're heading in as a society. Do we believe the vaccine passports are a temporary measure under the guise of eradicating a deadly virus or is this a blatant power grab with the intention to morph the passport into something far more radical? After all, a vaccine passport was considered radical only 18 months. Imagine the achievements in double-time. Restrictions of energy consumption via the use of carbon points or penalized for the types of groceries you buy in-store, ironically announced in the UK this week. A technocratic fascist delusion of China's present social credit system.

Passports are divisive and risk creating a two-tier society. The propaganda machine already pitches those who aren't vaccinated against those that are. Those that have been skeptical from the beginning have always noted that the government wouldn't physically force you to submit to inoculation but they will use all resources at their disposal (psychology and behavioral science) for compliance. Is this ethical? Will these techniques evolve further into radical changes to liberty?

They are a violation of informed consent. It's an unethical principle of coercion. There is a magnitude of factors as to why someone wouldn't want to innoculate. They can evaluate their own risk and read statistics. Concerns with the ethics and principles of the manufacturers. Religious grounds. Free will.

Are vaccine passports useful when the vaccines do not [limit the spread entirely?](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sees-drop-pfizer-vaccine-protection-against-infections-still-strong-2021-07-05/) Vaccinated people can spread the disease. Do vaccines offer protection against the variant factory? Vaccinated people are more likely to transmit the virus as the vaccine prevents symptoms of the disease only. They are less likely to know they even have the virus without being tested for it.

"My friend caught covid from her double jabbed friend
My friend was incredibly sick for a week, she was crying on the phone to me because her whole body was in so much pain, she sounded like a wheezing old man and could hardly speak. She has never been so sick in her life. She got this sickness from her friend who got double jabbed and promptly caught ""covid"" and was bedridden around the same time my friend fell ill (her friend did a PCR test and it was positive, i know the PCR tests are bullshit but still)

So, this friend of mine who has travelled and never gave a shit about covid suddenly caught it from her ""vaccinated"" friend. The ""delta variant"" is the vaccine variant. This vaccine is spreading ""covid"". My, my, my, i wonder when the penny will drop for the sheeple. Its taking a mighty long time but it seems the indoctrinated zombies are starting to slowly pry open their eyes and smell the coffee. I wonder how this will all unfold for them in the next few months and years. Oh us ""anti-vaxxers"" arent looking so ""stupid"" anymore.

"I'm so sick and tired if it all.
I'm tired of being told I'm uneducated - I majored in biology. Took pharmacology, microbiology, genetics, and others. I know how to do research and collect facts from genuine respectable sources. I'm not uneducated. 

I'm tired of being told I'm selfish - I do not care if someome gets a vaccine or not. I do not care if they stay home or not. I do not do anything to tell people how to live. I volunteer, I chose to serve, I help those in need whenever I can. I donated blood with every possible opportunity I ever could. I'm not selfish.

I'm tired of being told I'm afraid - I'm not afraid of covid. I live my life without the fear of something I already contracted killing me. I dont live in fear of breathing the same air as someone else. What I do see when I live my life is I see false propaganda plastered everywhere I currently am with false facts. The number ""zero severe cases for x number of vaccines for the military"" I personally have seen one of our own medevaced out of deployment due to vaccine reaction. Its a bold faced lie. I worry for our country and rights being taken away but I am not afraid. Covid will pass. I know nobody who has died of covid. Not a single person and I interact with close to 100 people every day. 

I'm tired being called names like grandma killer, fanatic, uneducated, selfish, stupid, etc.

It is nice to see that there are others that view things the same way and that I am not alone. Also since some people are curious about my background and I don't see an issue with being forthcoming, as stated in a comment below I used to be a nursing major. I did fail out of nursing school. I failed out due to having a 79% in two classes, which were Fs in the nursing department. I'm sure most students who attended college earned at least two ""traditional"" Cs throughout their time. I wish I studied more at 19, but unfortunately I didn't and that is what caused me to change to Biology. I graduated from my university never again earning anything less than an 80%, Bs in the science department. I'm know to some of you this matters very much. I'm not a doctor, scientist, or claim to be. Simply I studied certain subjects and know how to do research. I'm sure anyone who actually majored in a hard science knows that they aren't as simple as other degrees. I'm not going to continue on in explaining myself. I don't ask anyone else to.

"Dear Prime Minister..
**Open Letter from UK Christian Leaders to the UK's Prime Minister Concerning Vaccine Passport Proposals** 

To: The Prime Minister Boris Johnson  
**April 2021**  
   
Dear Prime Minister, 

As Christian leaders across a range of denominations, we continue to pray at this time for your government Ã¢â‚¬Å“and all in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignityÃ¢â‚¬Â (1 Timothy 2:2). 

However, we write to you concerning an area of the most serious concern, namely the potential introduction into our society of so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“vaccine passportsÃ¢â‚¬Â which have also been referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“COVID-status certificatesÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“freedom passesÃ¢â‚¬Â. We are wholly opposed to this suggestion and wish to make three points about the potential consideration of any scheme of this type. 

Firstly, to make vaccination the basis of whether someone is allowed entry to a venue, or participation in an activity, makes no logical sense in terms of protecting others. If the vaccines are highly effective in preventing significant disease, as seems to be the evidence from trial results to date, then those who have been vaccinated have already received protection; there is no benefit to them of other people being vaccinated. Further, since vaccines do not prevent infection *per se* even a vaccinated person could in theory carry and potentially pass on the virus, so to decide someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“safe non-spreaderÃ¢â‚¬Â status on the basis of proof of their immunity to disease is spurious. 

Secondly, the introduction of vaccine passports would constitute an unethical form of coercion and violation of the principle of informed consent. People may have various reasons for being unable or unwilling to receive vaccines currently available including, for some Christians, serious issues of conscience related to the ethics of vaccine manufacture or testing. We risk creating a two-tier society, a medical apartheid in which an underclass of people who decline vaccination are excluded from significant areas of public life. There is also a legitimate fear that this scheme would be the thin end of the wedge leading to a permanent state of affairs in which COVID vaccine status could be expanded to encompass other forms of medical treatment and perhaps even other criteria beyond that. This scheme has the potential to bring about the end of liberal democracy as we know it and to create a surveillance state in which the government uses technology to control certain aspects of citizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives. As such, this constitutes one of the most dangerous policy proposals ever to be made in the history of British politics. 

Finally, as Christian leaders we wish to state that we envisage no circumstances in which we could close our doors to those who do not have a vaccine passport, negative test certificate, or any other Ã¢â‚¬Å“proof of healthÃ¢â‚¬Â. For the Church of Jesus Christ to shut out those deemed by the state to be social undesirables would be anathema to us and a denial of the truth of the Gospel. The message we preach is given by God for all people and consists in nothing other than the free gift of grace offered in Christ Jesus, with the universal call to repentance and faith in him. To deny people entry to hear this life-giving message and to receive this life- giving ministry would be a fundamental betrayal of Christ and the Gospel. Sincere Christian churches and organisations could not do this, and as Christian leaders we would be compelled to resist any such Act of Parliament vigorously. 

We draw your attention to the recent Judicial Review overturning the Scottish GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ban on public worship, which demonstrates that such disproportionate prevention of the right to worship is a clear infringement under Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights. We cannot see how any attempt to prevent people gathering for worship on the basis of either testing or non-vaccination would not similarly be ruled to be a breach. We agree with those members of Parliament who have already voiced opposition to this proposal: that it would be divisive, discriminatory and destructive to introduce any such mandatory health certification into British society. We call on the government to assert strongly and clearly that it will not contemplate this illiberal and dangerous plan, not now and not ever.

"For the first time, I'm worried for my kids
15 years ago I would be as fired up as many of you on here, stocking up my arsenal and ready to start the revolt against the tyranny (because if the US doesn't do it, no other fucking country will).  But I'm not 20 anymore with no responsibility beyond myself.

Now with COVID passports being mandated in Franch and UK, combined with their versions of CPS taking kids away for not agreeing with their gender identity (not related, but correlates with government overreach).  How much longer do us family men and women have before CPS takes our kids away for child endangerment because they aren't vaccinated?

I am a sole earner, if it comes down to the vaccine or my family losing all income, I'll take the vaccine.  

But if they try to force that shit into my kids, there's literally no more lines that can be drawn, that's it.

Real life isn't Reddit, real life is making the decision to literally die protecting your family.  And the sad part is after they kill me, my kids will get the shot anyway after being taken from their mother.

I would strongly hope that the US revolts before we reach that point - but everything is happening so fast and all the ""conspiracy theories"" are actually spoilers as someone said.

"Why vaccine passports are an assault on democracy
The mere mention of vaccination passports or papers 18 months ago to enter any sort of societal-based establishment was immediately dismissed by the public and elitist officials as nonsensical or down-right conspiracy theorem. This coherently begs the question, if these undemocratic, liberty busting methods of ""public safety"" can be thrown across entire civilisations under the guise of fear and behavioural science, where do we draw the line? Once passports are normalised, could they morph into something more radical?

Stumble into the present, the same government and elitist officials label those against the use of vaccine papers as selfish conspiracy theorists pushing this narrative throughout the media arms which eventually filters down to the public. The public has now struck gold as the mental gymnastics Olympics often unwilling to venture outside their short-sighted view of reality and into the cuffs of the matrix.

I can understand the short-sightedness of the general public. (whilst extremely frustrating and puzzling for those that are able to sit on the cuffs of this reality) 

Government behavioral science and the collusion of propaganda fuelled fear into everyday citizens pushing the narrative that the virus is a threat to civilization. After all, no fear, no compliance with lockdown restrictions and vaccination requests.

Now, I won't go into detail in regards to the use of psychology and behavioral science in order to manipulate the masses and whether it was ethical. But there is an article here on the methods witnessed throughout the last 18 months. [Click](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0884-z).

Now, there is a famous quotation. **Never let a good crisis go to waste.** The control of civilizations with fear under the illusion of safety becomes normalized. Policies the public would have revolutionized against 18 months prior are now accepted and supported and those with critiquing opinions are dismissed or silenced. Do we want to live in a society where potentially ground-breaking ideas are silenced? Some of the most incredible revolutions and changes came from those on the fringes of society with alternate opinions to the mainstream status quo.

Do you want to live in a society where the status quo completely eradicates liberty, the expression of alternate opinion, and the right to be able to decide what's in you and your family's best interest? You think tyranny can't function in the west. You've been conditioned to believe that these ideals are reserved for countries such as China. But it's happening and it's here under the guise of safety.

Vaccine passports as a condition for societal normalcy are the single biggest assault on individual liberty in western politics. This goes beyond left-right politics. This ventures beyond the vaccinated/unvaccinated denominator. All groups should be alarmed.

&amp;#x200B;

The gravest concern here is the direction we're heading in as a society. Do we believe the vaccine passports are a temporary measure under the guise of eradicating a deadly virus or is this a blatant power grab with the intention to morph the passport into something far more radical? After all, a vaccine passport was considered radical only 18 months. Imagine the achievements in double-time. Restrictions of energy consumption via the use of carbon points or penalized for the types of groceries you buy in-store, ironically announced in the UK this week. A technocratic fascist delusion of China's present social credit system.

Passports are divisive and risk creating a two-tier society. The propaganda machine already pitches those who aren't vaccinated against those that are. Those that have been skeptical from the beginning have always noted that the government wouldn't physically force you to submit to inoculation but they will use all resources at their disposal (psychology and behavioral science) for compliance. Is this ethical? Will these techniques evolve further into radical changes to liberty?

They are a violation of informed consent. It's an unethical principle of coercion. There is a magnitude of factors as to why someone wouldn't want to innoculate. They can evaluate their own risk and read statistics. Concerns with the ethics and principles of the manufacturers. Religious grounds. Free will.

Are vaccine passports useful when the vaccines do not [limit the spread entirely?](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sees-drop-pfizer-vaccine-protection-against-infections-still-strong-2021-07-05/) Vaccinated people can spread the disease. Do vaccines offer protection against the variant factory? Vaccinated people are more likely to transmit the virus as the vaccine prevents symptoms of the disease only. They are less likely to know they even have the virus without being tested for it.

"Ok so one thing i dont get about vaccines
So the main point of vaccines is to achieve herd immunity. For vaccine to work effectively air quotes, it should be able to stop the spread of the virus, so that herd immunity can be achieved and the virus cant be spread. Now, most experts assume the percentage of population that needs to be vaccinated for herd immunity is about 70-75 percent ish. But, if the vaccine does not even stop the spread of the virus, and is not even very effective against the new variants, why are they being pushed? The point of a vaccine is to achieve herd immunity. But with vaccines not even stopping the spread why is it mandatory?",-1,negative
"Mass Vaccination with a leaky vaccine will open the door to medical tyranny
I think many of us are starting to suspect that the new Ã¢â‚¬Å“variantsÃ¢â‚¬Â are being caused by over vaccination. Your typical virus mutates to be less deadly but more contagious because it is not truly beneficial to a virus to have the host die. A less deadly virus is far more successful at spreading when it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kill its host.

Yesterday the medical establishment began admitting that vaccinated can carry the virus, that the vaccine only reduces symptoms. This means that the more deadly versions of the virus can thrive, rather than simply dying off with their hosts. This circumvents natural selection and allows deadly variants to emerge.

This is the beginning of a medical arms race. We will continue to produce booster shots which are better equipped to handle variants that emerge, but that will only give rise to new variants. The unvaccinated will bear the brunt of the death to begin with but hopefully will develop natural antibodies that can defend them. If the mass vaccinations continue, though, eventually the virus will win against any defense, natural or man-made. At some point the virus will actually be so deadly that a vaccine will be necessary to survive (for real, not like the very low death rate of the current variants).

In the meantime, the medical establishment will seize more and more power, leveraging peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s need for vaccine to survive and their proprietary knowledge of how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made to realize the new world order. At some point in the future there will likely be armed conflict between nations that are controlled and nations that are not.

"Increasing Levels of Rage From Vaccinated
Has anyone else noticed the increased levels of rage from the vaccinated?  Calling unvaccinated Ã¢â‚¬Å“plague ratsÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“disease spreadersÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“wish that we all dieÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we should all be forced out of employment or denied healthcareÃ¢â‚¬Â.
  
I think the vaccine messes with the emotion center in the brain and brings out much more anger and rage in people. Maybe we are heading toward a scenario like the movie Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am LegendÃ¢â‚¬Â?  DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all those vaccinated creatures have endless rage?
  
Maybe this was all designed this way because they want people to kill each other off. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how they achieve their depopulation.   Maybe the heart issues are from issues similar to if you are coked up all the time. Coked up people can be full of rage too.

"By the logic of vaccinated get sick by unvaccinted we shouldve been all dead by now by various diseases
It seems like that the other 50% of people werent capable of thinking in the first place. 
They were forced by Ã¢â‚¬Å¾groupÃ¢â‚¬Å“ to do this.
ItÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs like hanging out with people who consume drugs on a party, then youre the only one who doesnt want it, then youre afraid you will be abandoned or Ã¢â‚¬Å¾uncoolÃ¢â‚¬Å“ then take the drugs, too, and endup in a mess. And nobody cares what happens to you.

Or not caring about anything, they just want their rights back as soon as possible because its makes them feel vulnerable for staying away from the life they are so used to. and so cannot deal with that.


I mean how many people are not vaccinated against ordinary diseases. 
We were travelling, made business, tourism, met all kinds of people. And most of us didnt get sick. 

By wearing masks all the time, we are restricted from airflow. 
This sounds stupid, but since bill gates likes to eliminate co2 during his lifetime, why wouldnt he think of a glorious mask idea:
Ã¢â‚¬Å¾if they keep co2 in their mask, and they keep on breathing it back in, we can reduce co2 that way!Ã¢â‚¬Å“

I know, very stupid. But who knows?
Apart from that I know the brain is dying with having a mask on all the time. And if you dont switch masks during the day, you breathe dead bacteria and get pneumonia. 
Super healthy!

Now they talk about how vaccinated are spreaders. Shouldnt be that way.
That means they got injected with something to cause them getting sick. 
And this could result into a pingpong effect.

"Sick with COVID 9 months ago, blacked out after first Pfizer dose with strange symptoms.
Long story short, I got infected with COVID about 9 months ago. Fast forward to yesterday when I received my first Pfizer dose and I honestly thought I was dying.

The first few minutes were fine, I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t freaking out beforehand. As soon as I started talking to my mom (who was sitting next to me), my vision started blacking out, it was hard to breathe, cold sweats and I felt this really strange sensation throughout my body. The best way I can describe it is warm waves starting from my head and slowly making their way down to my feet. This went on for a few minutes.

I was totally incoherent and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t move a muscle. All I remember is my mom and the nurses talking at me and being incapable of responding.

About half an hour later I felt better, but I was still dizzy and nauseous throughout the day. Needless to say, I did NOT expect this type of reaction. Everyone I know who has received their first dose said they essentially felt nothing other than the typical symptoms. 

I was the only one out of my close friends and family to get sick with COVID.

Is it possible that my body might have too many antibodies from being sick before? My case was pretty serious and I was suffering from long COVID up until this summer.

I went for an ultrasound on the swelling today, the good news is there are no abscesses or anything, the weird news is.. he told me the swelling isn't going to go away. This news is still worrying for me as I keep being told they don't know what is causing it. The man who did the ultrasound said that it might be due to irritation of the muscle. It is also a little weird and worrying to hear that it is going to be there for the rest of my life. 

I am just coming onto here for any advice on what the swelling might be. He said I should be okay getting a second vaccine but I don't want to irritate the same area more and recieve more swelling, I am not sure what to do about getting the vaccine again either because of all this.

"Hair Loss after COVID -19 vaccine
After I took my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer), my head was really itchy,  and my hair was dry, almost the same texture as hay. I then took the second dose, and my hair started to fall out with every brush. My hair is starting to thin, I hope I'm not the only one who is dealing with this issue. But, if anyone is dealing with this please share you story and issue. 

I wish you the best!",0,neutral
"Flare Ups and COVID vaccine
Weeks after getting my first dose of Pfizer I had the worst flare up iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever had. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not anti-vax and am still going to get my second dose, but after doing amazing for over 6 months and being able to move out alone to Melbourne (which I am handling pretty well) the vaccine is the only outlier in my routine. For me it is the only thing that can explain my flare up. I was wondering if anyone has similar issues?

"Birth Control to help regulate Covid jab 2week periods?
I used to get my period on a regular monthly schedule but ever since I had my 2nd Covid jab (Moderna) I've been getting my period every 2 weeks. I was told it would take 4 months to get back on schedule but it hasn't so far and I'm getting fed up of it. Would going on birth control help regulate my period again? Any other ideas to get it back on track or any resources for me to check out? Next time I talk to my doctor I'd like to be more prepared because they don't really seem to have any answers for me and it might help if I had more information to help them out.",0,neutral
"3rd COVID booster side effects?
Had my third booster on Saturday afternoon. Sunday had the same effects as my 2nd booster, just some soreness and lethargic. Last night I started having chest tightness and today twice my Apple Watch has warned me my heart rate is over 120 this is while I am sitting at my desk calmly. I verified with a blood pressure cuff I have and it was 130 each time (waited 15 minutes apart).  Is this just a side effect or something I should be more concerned about?",0,neutral

Two months ago I got my 2nd covid vaccine shot (Pfizer) and I felt completely fine afterwards, I had no other side effects beside the pain in my arm. Yesterday I started experiencing pain in my left arm again. The pain is very mild and it comes and goes (it's not there the whole time). It could be something else, but I fell the pain in the exact same spot where I felt it after vaccination. My arm looks completely normal, I can't see anything that could be off.

"Frozen Shoulder from 1st Covid Jab. Concerned about All vax jabs going forward.
60F / 5'7/ 215lbs / African American  /Left Sholder       
Meds: Qvar/Nexium/ArmourThyroid (Asthma/Occaisional Gastritis/Hypothyroidism)      
Pre-diabetic: A1C 5.7     
   
After my first covid jab (Pfizer) in Feb., I developed frozen shoulder in Left Arm (I'm right handed.)      
I took the 2nd jab in Right Arm as a result. No issues. 
    
I started PT about 3 weeks after the 2nd jab for about 3 months and now work out on my own. It's about 85% better. I can put my own bra on, and that's a big sign that things are improving... but there are still some limited motion issues and it's still pretty achy.
   
To be honest, I'm concerned about vaccines going forward. Not just Covid Vax... ALL vax's. 
   
What are the chances that my covid booster, if given in my left shoulder, could make my frozen shoulder worse? Should I take the jab in Right Arm again? Are there other places on the body that vaxs can be administered?    
   
I know my ortho md told me diabetics are more predisposed to getting frozen shoulder. I'm pre-diabetic but my a1c has been 5.7 - 5. 8 for several years now. I'm not diabetic, but i guess I'm worried if this pre-diabetic thing could be a contributor.   
   
My sister said she had a similar frozen shoulder reaction 20 years ago and she - at the time - was a competitive biker. Great shape / not diabetic by any shot. Is this hereiditary?    
    
I want to get a flu shot but i'm scared. 60 yr old and i'm pussy-ing out. I'm bummed and concerned about this because the frozen shoulder costs money, (PT) takes time from my day, contributes to bad sleep (I can't sleep on my left side, which is my norm), and frankly, is painful.",0,neutral
"Covid Vaccine + Tegretol Interactions
So, I'm in the group of people who are recommended get a third dose of vaccine.

On my second dose, I didn't have much if any ill effects from the jab. Not a sore arm, fever or anything. But I had side effects from the Tegretol. I was out of my mind for 4 days, couldn't think straight, couldn't remember anything, sick to my stomach. These are all the symptoms I feel when I'm not on my meds.

I'm hoping to find a group who is on Tegretol and had the vax's. Did anyone by chance experience the same? Did you happen to get a third dose?

I'm utterly terrified about potentially making myself out of my mind getting the third one, but I ultimately need to keep myself safe too. Just looking to get others experiences, the appointment is booked.

"I think I might have covid
Luckily I had my first dose of vaccination, but I feel terrible. My stomach feels empty but my head hurts so much that I feel like I'm going to vomit. 

It came at the worst time, I have a tedtalk speech in a week and I'm losing relevance in my friend group. It's one of those groups that when you stay off for a while everyone forgets you, and when I texted the group chat that I had covid only one person responded. 

I'm dealing with terrible depression and PTSD, being in school was a distraction, and I'm terrified that covid would make my exhaustion somehow worse for months because I heard people suffer the consequences for so long. 

Just needed a place to be whiny, thank you for coming to my tedtalk.",0,positive

Hi,

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a 30f, 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢3, ~200lbs, white. 

I recently received the COVID booster shot as recommended by my obgyn because I am breastfeeding and gave birth ~6 weeks ago.   

I received the vaccine on Monday felt fine initially but about 36 hours after the shot I developed a fever/sore throat/headache/chills/congestion. I felt like shit basically. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on day four since being vaxed, all the other side effects have cleared up but I still have a headache and my ear has started to ache as well. (This usually happens when I am congested and it clears out) Is this a normal reaction? Should I see a doctor? All I see online is that the symptoms should be gone by day 4.",0,neutral

"Is my abdominal pain from food poisoning or a covid vaccine side effect?
(21M - 67KG) 4 days before I got the vaccine I had a minor food poisoning. Diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain etc. These symptoms went away 2 days before I had my 2nd Pfizer vaccine on the 29th of September. 

After the vaccine I had this abdominal pain specific on the bottom left side of my belly a few cm next to my belly button. 

The pain is not unbearable, I can still press the area with no pain. But it comes in goes in random intervals and the pain is subtle and sharp.

Its been a week and 3 days now and I have no other symptoms only this. Is this just a remanence of my food poisoning or a side effect of my second dose of Pfizer? My GP is unavailable on weekends and the latest I can see her is Tuesday.",0,neutral
"4 hours of REM Sleep after covid jab
I received the first moderna jab yesterday and woke up this morning to my sleep tracker saying that my sleep was poor. I had 2 hours of deep sleep,4 hours REM and 2 hours light. This is the most REM Sleep I have ever got and apparently, it is not good to get too much.

"[30F] Pfizer COVID Booster (3rd dose)
Just wanted to share my experience with the Pfizer COVID booster (3rd dose) so far. I (30F, immunocompromised) work in healthcare and got my second dose of Pfizer mid-March. I got my booster around 4pm yesterday and within 3 hours my arm was very sore and I was getting a mild headache, and drowsiness. By 9pm that night my arm was much more sore and I was easily able to just knock out (normally I struggle with insomnia) and my headache was getting worse. This morning I woke up about 630am and my headache was pretty severe, to the point where Excedrin and Ibuprofen weren't doing anything, and my arm was very sore (no swelling or redness though), plus some nausea. My headache is almost unbearable at this point, my arm is still very sore, I feel a little fatigued, and I've had diarrhea. So far I've had less of a reaction than I did to my second dose. Within 12 hours of getting my second dose I was running a high fever, had a severe headache with body aches, diarrhea and severe fatigue - but it only lasted about 24 hours and I was good to go. My first dose I had a little arm soreness and a headache, but was otherwise fine.

Fingers crossed it doesn't get much worse than this and that the weekend isn't completely ruined, haha. In two weeks I'll be allowed to get my flu vaccine.

UPDATE: over 24 hours later - sore arm, nausea and vomited once, headache, severe fatigue, decreased appetite, mild body aches. Still hanging in there and happy there has been no fever so far.

48 hours later: Arm in minimally sore, no body aches but still mildly nauseous with fatigue and a headache. Headache definitely isn't as bad as yesterday. Overall feeling MUCH better. My appetite is also still decreased, but I'm not really gonna complain about that.",0,neutral
"Does anyone else kinda like the ""sick for a day"" side effect from COVID vaccines?
Weird to say/think I know but when I got my first two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, I felt like I had my annual cold symptoms, which would usually last a few days because I would actually be sick but with the vaccines, the symptoms are just an immune response and disappear within 24 hours. I just got my booster shot yesterday and I'm starting to feel some mild chills, a 'sourness' in my throat, etc. so I know I'm starting to get ""sick"".

Idk how to put it, really, but I find it cool/satisfying that the reason why I'm ""sick"" is that I got vaccinated and it's only a side effect so that I won't *actually* get sick. And wth, it's nice to have an excuse to lie in a bundle and do nothing because you're ""sick"" for the day.",1,positive

Im a type 2 diabetic and got my 3rd (Pfizer) shot on Monday. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been vaccinated for a year now but only got diagnosed since January.

"I (24F) need help with good sound responses to the BS my aunt constantly says about Covid and Trump
I don't know if this is the right place to post this but here it is.. 

So, my (24F) aunt (54F) is very staunchly republican. She consistently is posting on Facebook and saying things about how it's against our freedoms for them to make a vaccine mandate about how the government can't tell you what to do with your own body etc.

 She was saying that even about wearing masks! She believes that every time she is in contact with someone who has gotten the vaccine that that is the reason she has been having weird period problems. She talks about how Trump did so much for the country. 

She works for a chiropractor who is not a good person and she just repeats everything he says as gospel. The real problem is she lives with my mom and has gotten her to believe all this! As a consequence I don't see either of them to protect my young unable to be vaccinated children.

 I'm tired of ignoring her false and utterly ridiculous posts I want to be able to counter her beliefs with good logical facts and arguments but I struggle with that. I just miss my family and I want them to realize they are wrong and get vaccinated so my kids can see their Nana and aunt and other family.",1,positive
