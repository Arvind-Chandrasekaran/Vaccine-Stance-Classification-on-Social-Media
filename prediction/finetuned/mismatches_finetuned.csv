"Covid Booster
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m scheduled to have my booster the end of the month when IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 29 weeks pregnant. BUT my friend was telling me her doctor recommended getting the booster at 36 weeks so placenta will pass more antibodies to the baby. Debating if I should change my appointment? Anyone been given more direct advice on when to get the booster and how to promote the antibodies in baby?",1,neutral,"1,2,3,4,5"
"Covid Booster Shot Experiences
I was fully vaccinated (Pfizer) back in April of this year. Over the summer I had an ectopic pregnancy and received methotrexate, so this month is the first that we are clear to ttc again. 

I am interested in receiving the booster Covid vaccination when IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m able to, but am curious if anyone has gotten a booster shot and noticed that it affected your cycle at all? Thanks!",1,neutral,"4,5"
"Covid Vaccine
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m struggling with severe anxiety getting the vaccine. I have anxiety anytime I take any new medications. Even with the annual flu shot. I scheduled it today and was crying so bad I changed it to tomorrow. I want to go with positive thoughts. Any positive experiences are appreciated. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m planning on Pfizer.",1,neutral,"1,2,3,4,5"
"Pregnant need advice on Covid booster
Age 30, white female, 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢8Ã¢â‚¬Â 155 lbs. hashimotoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thyroid and anxiety. Levothyroxine and sertraline.

I am 4.5 weeks pregnant. 

I am a nurse who got the second dose of Pfizer back in January. I am eligible for the booster. Would it be better to get it now or later on in my pregnancy?

Thanks",1,neutral,"1,4"

"When to get covid vaccine booster?
I got vaccinated back in March and April (Pfizer). IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 12 weeks pregnant today and already diagnosed with gestational diabetes. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also overweight. I asked my dr when I should get the booster since I am in several high risk categories. They said itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine to get it when I reach my second trimester which is coming up but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a scenario where I absolutely need to get the booster ASAP. However I asked them if antibodies would pass to the baby if I get vaccinated in my second trimester they said they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if it is like tdap where the antibodies pass later in pregnancy. I would prefer to wait a bit if antibodies donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pass until later in pregnancy but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have this information. Does anyone have the data behind if covid antibodies pass to the baby if I get vaccinated at the beginning of my second trimester? Is it better to wait? Thank you.",1,neutral,"1,2,3,4,5"
"mum wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop pestering me after covid vaccine
my (20f) mum wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop annoying me after i got the covid vaccine. She is anti vax but got the vaccine because she needed it to work. I was also anti vax until i got it a few weeks ago. The thing is, she keeps telling everyone that there is Ã¢â‚¬Å“absolutely nothing to be scared aboutÃ¢â‚¬Â when thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just not the reality, there is side affects and rare adverse reactions, everyone knows that. But she goes around telling me and my boyfriend (who is more at risk of myocarditis) that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no side effects?? and then she tells us that she had an ongoing headache for two weeks?? like she literally told me i wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a sore arm and obviously i did have an extremely sore arm after i got it. I know sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to be positive but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really annoying. She even wanted to stay at my boyfriend and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place the night i got it because she literally thought something terrible was going to happen to me, and ever since then she calls me everyday asking if iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m okay from it. i swear she actually thinks itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poison and iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m pissed off",1,negative,"1,2,3,4,5"
"Knowing the covid vaccine works for personal experience?
I have confidence in the vaccines, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discouraging to hear about all the breakthrough cases. Has anyone here whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vaccinated been heavily exposed to someone with covid and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made you have faith in the vaccines from personal experience?",0,positive,"1,2,3,4,5"
